## SPECIAL RULES

**Gifts of Galadriel** – Upon leaving Lothlórien, the Fellowship are presented with a series of gifts to aid them in their quest.  
Each member of the Fellowship will gain the item listed below, which will have the effects detailed:

- **Frodo – Light of Eärendil** `ACTIVE` – Each turn Frodo may use a single 'free' Will point to attempt to cast the Blinding Light Magical Power. This is cast on a 3+ and cannot be Channeled. Frodo cannot use this if he is wearing the Ring.
- **Sam – Elven Rope** `ACTIVE` – Sam always counts as rolling a 6 for any Climb, Jump, or Leap tests that he has to make.
- **Merry & Pippin – Daggers of the Noldorin** `ACTIVE` – Merry & Pippin may re-roll any failed To Wound rolls in combat.
- **Aragorn – Elven Dagger** `ACTIVE` – This is an Elven-made dagger with the Uruk-haibane special rule.
- **Legolas – Bow of the Galadhrim** `ACTIVE` – Whilst within 3" of a friendly model, Legolas may re-roll any failed To Hit rolls when shooting.
- **Gimli – Galadriel's Locks** `ACTIVE` – Gimli may re-roll all dice in a Duel roll. Gimli may only use this ability three times per game.
- **Boromir – Golden Belt** `ACTIVE` – Boromir gains the Woodland Creature special rule.

**Blessing of Galadriel** – Friendly models always count as having had the Fortify Spirit Magical Power cast upon them. This is always in effect, even if their Will points have been reduced to 0.

**The Bond of Fellowship** – Models from this Legendary Legion count as in range of a banner if there is another friendly model within 3".

**"You have my Sword"** – As long as Frodo is alive and on the table (or escapes the board in Scenarios where this applies), all models from this Legendary Legion gain the Fearless special rule. Additionally, this force will never be considered Broken whilst Frodo is alive and on the table (or escapes the board in Scenarios where this applies).
