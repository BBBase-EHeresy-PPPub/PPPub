## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A The Black Riders force must always include the Witch-king of Angmar, who is always the army's leader.

- Only a maximum of nine models can be included in this Legendary Legion.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Terror in the Night** – A model in range of between four and six models from this force with the Harbinger of Evil special rule suffers an additional -1 to their Courage value. A model in range of between seven and nine models from this force with the Harbinger of Evil special rule suffers an additional -2 to their Courage value.

**Screech of the Nazgûl** – Each Ringwraith can, once per game, cast the Channelled version of the Transfix Magical Power without declaring a Heroic Channelling. This Magical Power is automatically cast, counting the result as a 6, and no Will points are expended. Target models can make a Resist test as normal. Make sure to note which of the Ringwraith models have used this ability, as each Ringwraith can only use this ability once per game.

**The Will of Sauron** – Friendly Ringwraith models do not lose a Will point for being in combat as per their Will of Evil special rule.

**Hunt the Ringbearer** – At the start of the Fight phase, before other Heroic Actions are declared, if it would be possible for a friendly Ringwraith model to Charge an enemy model with the One Ring following a successful Heroic Combat, that Ringwraith model may declare a Heroic Combat without spending Might. Only one Ringwraith can declare a 'free' Heroic Combat in this way per turn.

If successful, the Ringwraith that declared the Heroic Combat must Charge the enemy model with the One Ring, though any other models that move as part of the Heroic Combat may act as normal. 

The player who declared this 'free' Heroic Combat automatically wins the roll-off to see which Heroic Combat goes first (if applicable), though they must select this 'free' Heroic Combat before any others.
