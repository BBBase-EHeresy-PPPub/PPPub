## SPECIAL RULES

**Great Resilience** – Whenever a friendly Bear model suffers a Wound, roll a D6. On a 5+ the Wound is ignored just as if a point of Fate had been spent.

**Charge of the Bear** – Whilst they have the Bear keyword, Beorn and Grimbeorn gain the Monstrous Charge special rule.

**Natural Resistance** – Friendly models gain the Resistant to Magic special rule.

**Fuelled by Fury** – Beorn and Grimbeorn do not need to roll for their Skinchanger special rule; they can transform at will.
