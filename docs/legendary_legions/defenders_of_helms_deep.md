## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Defenders of Helm's Deep force must include Théoden. Théoden is always the army leader.
- All models from this Legendary Legion must have the Infantry keyword.
- A Defenders of Helm's Deep Legendary Legion may only have a maximum of 33% of its models with the Lórien keyword.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Fight in Ranks!** – Friendly Rohan Infantry models armed with throwing spears may use them as standard spears in addition to their normal use. However, if a model uses their spear as a throwing spear in a turn, they cannot use it as a standard spear in the same turn.

**Give them a Volley** – Models from this Legendary Legion armed with either a bow, longbow, or Elf bow may increase the range of their type of bow from 24" to 30", provided they have not moved that turn.

**Fall Back to the Keep!** – If this force is Broken, then Warrior models from this force add 1 to their Courage value. Additionally, if this force is Broken, friendly Warrior models may re-roll failed Courage tests whilst they are within 6" of Théoden.
