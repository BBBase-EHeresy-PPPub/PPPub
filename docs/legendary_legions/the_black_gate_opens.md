## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Black Gate Opens force must include a Mordor Troll Chieftain. This Mordor Troll Chieftain is counted as being a Hero of Valour and must be the force’s leader. Additional Mordor Troll Chieftains remain as normal.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Greatest of the Trolls** – The Troll Chieftain that duels with Aragorn is unlike the others of its race – tougher, more powerful and far more deadly.  
The Mordor Troll Chieftain that is your leader gains the Fearless special rule and an additional point of Might, Will, and Fate.

**The Hordes of Mordor** – Countless Orcs streamed out of the Black Gate, and when they fight in numbers, they become even more ferocious.  
Mordor Orc models gain a bonus of +1 To Wound in a Duel in which they outnumber their opponent in the Fight. Note that supporting models do not count for either side for the purpose of this rule.
