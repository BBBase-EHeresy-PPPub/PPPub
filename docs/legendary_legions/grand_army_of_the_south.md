## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Grand Army of the South force must always include either Suladân the Serpent Lord or the Mûmak War Leader (it may have both if you wish).
- Only Mahûd Hero models may lead Mahûd Warrior models.
- At least 50% of the models in a Grand Army of the South force must have the Haradrim keyword.
- Your force must include at least one Mûmak model.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Hail of Poisoned Arrows** – The tribes of the Haradrim are known to coat the tips of their arrows with vile and exotic toxins, and loose dark clouds of these lethal missiles towards the ranks of their foes in battle.  
A Grand Army of the South force may have 50% of its Warrior models armed with bows.

**The Making of a King** – The leaders of the south will stop at nothing to further their claim to rule, challenging the generals of opposing armies to a fight to the death.  
Your army's leader may declare a free Heroic Action at the start of any Fight phase in which they are Engaged in combat with the enemy leader. If the Mûmak War Leader is your leader, he may still use this ability whilst atop his Royal War Mûmak, in which case the Mûmak will be affected as if it had been the one to declare the Heroic Action.

**War Beasts for the South** – The sight of the gigantic Mûmakil sends a chill down the spine of all those at Pelennor, filling their hearts with dread and doubt.  
All Mûmak models in your force gain the Harbinger of Evil special rule.

**Warrior Pride** – The Mahûd are a violent people, spurred on by their leaders' ferocity in battle.  
Mahûd Warrior models that are within 6" of a friendly Mahûd Hero model that is Engaged in combat automatically pass all Courage tests they are required to make.
