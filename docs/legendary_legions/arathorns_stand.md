## SPECIAL RULES

**"They're dangerous folk, wandering the wilds"** – Rangers of the North and Dúnedain from this Legendary Legion may benefit from the Stand Fast! of Arathorn or Halbarad. Additionally, Rangers of the North and Dúnedain from this Legendary Legion increase their Attacks value to 2 while they have the Infantry keyword.

**Masters of Terrain** – Friendly models gain the Woodland Creature and Mountain Dweller special rules.

**Heir of Isildur** – Whenever Arathorn expends a Might point, roll a D6. On a 4+ the point of Might is free and does not reduce Arathorn's store of Might.

**Silent Ambush** – In scenarios where you roll for additional forces to arrive (such as those that use the Reinforcement rule), you receive a bonus of +1 to the dice roll for warbands from this Legendary Legion. In scenarios where you roll to see which part of the board your warbands deploy in, you may modify the dice roll by +1 or -1.
