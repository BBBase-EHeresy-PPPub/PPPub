## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Helm's Guard force must include Helm Hammerhand. Helm Hammerhand is always the army leader.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Defend the Súthburg!** – Friendly Rohan Infantry models armed with throwing spears may use them as standard spears in addition to their normal use. However, if a model uses their spear as a throwing spear in a turn, they cannot use it as a standard spear in the same turn.

**The King of Rohan** – Helm Hammerhand gains the Mighty Hero special rule. Additionally, Helm Hammerhand may declare a Heroic Combat each turn without spending Might.
