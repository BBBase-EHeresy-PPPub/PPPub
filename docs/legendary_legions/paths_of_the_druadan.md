## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Paths of the Drúadan force must always include Théoden, King of Rohan, who is always the army's leader.
- A Paths of the Drúadan force must always include Ghân-buri-Ghân and a full warband of Woses Warriors. Ghân-buri-Ghân is the only Hero that can include Woses Warriors in his warband.
- Riders of Rohan within this Legendary Legion do not count towards your force's Bow Limit.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Waypoints** – At the start of the game, before either side has deployed, this Legendary Legion's controlling player may place three 25mm Waypoint Markers anywhere on the board.  
Whilst within 6" of a friendly Waypoint Marker, friendly Rohan models do not suffer any penalties for moving, or charging, through difficult terrain.

**Kill Orc-folk** – Friendly models may re-roll 1s To Wound when making strikes against any Orc, Goblin, or Uruk-hai model.

**Know All Paths** – If, during the Move phase, models from both sides have declared a Heroic Move and a roll-off is required to see which side's Heroic Move happens first, this force will gain a bonus to that roll.  
If they would normally win the roll-off on a 4+, they will instead win the roll-off on a 3+. If they would normally win the roll-off on a 1, 2, or 3, they will instead win the roll-off on a 1, 2, 3, or 4.
