## ADDITIONAL RULES

## SPECIAL RULES

**Leader of the Pack** – The Wild Warg Chieftain that is the leader gains an additional point each of Might, Will, and Fate. Additionally, they are treated as a Hero of Valour.

**Howl of the Wolf Pack** – Once per game, at the start of any Fight phase, the Wild Warg Chieftain that is your leader can declare they are using this ability. Until the end of the turn, friendly models from this Legendary Legion gain a bonus of +1 to their Fight value and may re-roll any 1s when rolling To Wound.

**Protect the Alpha** – If the Wild Warg Chieftain that is your leader has suffered at least one Wound, then friendly models within 6" of them are counted as being in range of a banner.

**Feral Charge** – When a friendly Warg model charges an enemy Infantry model, they gain the Knock to the Ground bonus as if they were Cavalry. This bonus is lost if they are subsequently charged by an enemy Cavalry model.
