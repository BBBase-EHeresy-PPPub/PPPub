## ADDITIONAL RULES

- An Uglúk's Scouts force must include Uglúk. Uglúk is always the army leader.
- Only Orc Hero models may lead Orc Warrior models.
- Only Uruk-hai Hero models may lead Uruk-hai Warrior models.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Their Pace has Quickened** – If your army includes Mauhúr, then any Uruk-hai Scouts in your force may be upgraded to Mauhúr's Marauders rather than just the ones in Mauhúr's warband – this upgrade is free rather than costing 1 point per model. Additionally, Uglúk, Uruk-hai Scout Captains, and Uruk-hai Drummers increase their Move value to 8".

**Make Haste to Isengard** – Friendly models gain the Woodland Creature special rule.

**Animosity** – Friendly Orc models gain a bonus of +1 To Wound in the Fight phase if they are involved in the same fight as a friendly Uruk-hai model. Friendly Uruk-hai models gain a bonus of +1 To Wound in the Fight phase if they are involved in the same fight as a friendly Orc model.
