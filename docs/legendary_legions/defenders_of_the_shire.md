- Hobbit Archers in Pippin's warband must be upgraded to Tookish Hunters.

## SPECIAL RULES

**"Fear! Fire! Foes!"** – Friendly Hobbit models gain the Woodland Creature special rule.

**Heroes of the Shire** – Friendly Hobbit Hero models may benefit from the Stand Fast! of Merry.

**Laying in Wait** – After both sides have deployed, but before the first turn of the game begins, a player using a Defenders of the Shire force may place eight 25mm Trap markers on the board: two each of Snare Trap, Tripwire Trap, Pitfall Trap and Dummy Trap markers following the rules given on page 64.

**Ambush!** – At the start of the game, before any models are deployed, you may select a single warband led by a Hobbit Hero that is not Frodo, Sam, Merry or Pippin. That warband is ambushing and does not deploy on the board as normal. Instead, once both players have completed their third Move phase, the ambushing warband must choose one of the following:

- Move onto the board from any board edge via the rules for Reinforcements.  
or  
- Deploy in, or within 1" of, a wood, building, rocky outcrop, or other similar piece of terrain that Hobbits could hide in.  

A degree of common sense is required when deciding which pieces of terrain the Hobbits can ambush from – Hobbits shouldn't be leaping out from behind a single rock or from a river! It is best to decide with your opponent before the game which pieces of terrain your Hobbits can ambush from. Models deployed in this way may not be placed within the Control Zones of any enemy models. Models that enter the board in this way cannot move any further that turn, and count as having moved half of their Move allowance for the purposes of shooting.
