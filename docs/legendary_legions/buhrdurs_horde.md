## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Buhrdûr's Horde force must always include Buhrdûr, Troll Chieftain, who is always the army's leader.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Masters of Terrain** – Friendly models gain the Woodland Creature and Mountain Dweller special rules.

**A Fearsome Foe** – Buhrdûr gains the Blood and Glory special rule. Additionally, if Buhrdûr kills an enemy Hero in combat, he gains the Fearless special rule for the remainder of the battle.

**Ambushers** – Buhrdûr's warband is ambushing and does not deploy on the board as normal. Instead, at the end of both players' third Move phase, the ambushing warband must choose one of the following:  

Move onto the board from any board edge via the rules for Reinforcements.  

Or

Deploy in or within 1" of a wood, building, rocky outcrop, or other similar piece of terrain that the warband could hide in. Models deployed in this way may not be placed within the Control Zones of any enemy models. Models that enter the board in this way count as having moved half of their Move allowance for the purpose of shooting.
