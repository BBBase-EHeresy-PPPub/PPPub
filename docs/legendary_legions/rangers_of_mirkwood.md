## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Rangers of Mirkwood force must contain either Legolas Greenleaf, Prince of Mirkwood, or Tauriel.
- A Rangers of Mirkwood force may have 100% of its models armed with bows.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Knife Mastery** – The Rangers of Mirkwood are masters with their knives, able to use them to deflect incoming blows and find the weak spot in an enemy's armour.  
Friendly models may re-roll 1s To Wound when making strikes. Additionally, friendly models may use the Shielding special rule even though they are not armed with a shield; however, if they elect to shield, they may not use their Knife Fighters or Blade Mistress special rules.

**The Prince of Mirkwood** – Much like the Rangers he leads, Legolas is an exceptional fighter with the knives he wields.  
Legolas gains the Knife Fighters special rule when part of this Legendary Legion.

**Clear the Nests** – The spiders that infect Mirkwood have become a blight on the Woodland Realm, and the Elves will do all they can to cleanse the forest of these creatures.  
Friendly models gain the Hatred (Spider) special rule.

**Masters of the Forest** – The Mirkwood Rangers are well accustomed to fighting within the forest and will use trees and undergrowth as cover or to launch attacks from.  
Whenever a friendly model that is within 1" of a tree or within a piece of woodland terrain suffers a Wound, roll a D6. On the roll of a natural 6, that Wound is ignored exactly as if a point of Fate had been spent.

**Silent Ambush** – Mirkwood Rangers are masters of stealth, able to sneak up on their quarry and attack when it benefits them most.  
In scenarios where you roll for additional forces to arrive (such as those that use the Reinforcements rule), you receive a bonus of +1 to the dice roll for warbands from this Legendary Legion. In scenarios where you roll to see which part of the board your warbands deploy in, you may modify the dice roll by +1 or -1.
