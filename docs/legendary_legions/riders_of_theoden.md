## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Riders of Théoden force must always include Théoden, King of Rohan (the clue is in the name!), who is always the army's leader.
- Dernhelm may be deployed as part of Elfhelm's warband if you so wish. If you do this, Dernhelm will count as an Independent Hero.

## SPECIAL RULES

**"Ride for Ruin and the World's Ending!"** – Friendly Rohan Cavalry models gain +1 Strength on a turn in which they Charge.

**"Death!"** – The King of Rohan's battlecry inspired all that followed him to perform great deeds that would be worthy of remembrance.  
Once per game, at the start of any Fight phase, so long as he is alive and on the battlefield, Théoden can declare that he is using this ability. Every friendly Rohan Hero within 12" may declare either a Heroic Combat or Heroic Strike (if able) without expending Might points to do so.
