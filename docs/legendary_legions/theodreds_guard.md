## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Théodred's Guard force must always include Théodred, Heir of Rohan, who is always the army's leader.

## SPECIAL RULES

**Protect the Prince** – All models in this force gain the Sworn Protector (Théodred) special rule.

**Riders of Théodred** – Captains of Rohan, Riders of Rohan, and Rohan Royal Guard treat Théodred as if he were Théoden for the purpose of their Arise Riders of Théoden special rule.

**Fight in Ranks!** – Friendly Rohan Infantry models armed with throwing spears may use them as standard spears in addition to their normal use. However, if a model uses their spear as a throwing spear in a turn, they cannot use it as a standard spear in the same turn.
