## ADDITIONAL RULES

- A Host of the Dragon Emperor force must include the Dragon Emperor of Rhûn, who is always the army’s leader.

## SPECIAL RULES

**The Dragon Cults** – As the Easterlings march to war upon Erebor, the Dragon Emperor has ordered that the Dragon Cult join them on the battlefield.  
Easterling Warriors and Easterling Kataphrakts in warbands led by the Dragon Emperor or Easterling Dragon Knights do not need to pay the points to be upgraded to Black Dragons – this upgrade is free.

**Heroes of the Easterlings** – The Easterlings are proud warriors whose leaders relish the chance to fight, and the assault on Erebor provides them with a platform to claim the glory they seek.  
Easterling Hero models may re-roll a D6 in a Duel roll.

**No Quarter was Asked** – The Easterlings relish the art of warfare and will fight to the bitter end in the name of the Dark Lord.  
Easterling models receive +1 Courage when their force is Broken. Additionally, once per game, in Scenarios in which a dice is rolled to see when the game ends, as long as there is at least one friendly Easterling Hero model alive and on the battlefield, the Easterling player may choose to have the dice re-rolled if the Scenario ends before they wish it to.
