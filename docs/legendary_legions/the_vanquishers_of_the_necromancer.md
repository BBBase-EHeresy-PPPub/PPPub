## SPECIAL RULES

**"Are you in need of Assistance?"** – Friendly models gain a bonus of +1 to Resist tests if they are within 6" of another friendly model.

**Masters of Magic** – Friendly models may still attempt to cast Magical Powers even if they are already engaged in combat.

**Meddle not in the Affairs of Wizards** – The Attacks characteristic of Wizard models in this Legendary Legion is always equal to their remaining Wounds.

**Lady of the Golden Wood** – Galadriel may target any enemy model with the Banishment Magical Power as if it were a Spirit model. Non-Spirit models targeted by Galadriel's Banishment gain a single ‘free' point of Will to immediately Resist this Magical Power. Additionally, friendly models within 3" of Galadriel gain Resistant to Magic.

**The Grey Wanderer** – Gandalf gains the Fearless special rule. Furthermore, friendly models within 3" of Gandalf cannot have their Courage value reduced by enemy Magical Powers or special rules.

**Lord of Imladris** – Elrond may declare a Heroic Strike every Fight phase without expending Might. Additionally, other friendly models within 3" of Elrond count as being in range of a banner.

**Wisest of the Istari** – Saruman can attempt to cast two Magical Powers each turn rather than one, but may not attempt to cast the same Magical Power twice or target the same model twice. Additionally, when other friendly models within 3" of Saruman attempt to cast a Magical Power, they may re-roll a single D6 as part of the casting attempt.

**Protector of the Greenwood** – Once each turn, at any point in his Move phase, Radagast may choose a single model in base contact with him and roll a D6. On a 4 or 5, the chosen model regains a Wound lost earlier in the battle; on a 6, the model regains all of its lost Wounds. Additionally, friendly models within 3" of Radagast may move through difficult terrain without penalty.

**"Go Back to the Void, from Whence You Came!"** – Once per game, if Galadriel has at least 1 Will point remaining, Galadriel may choose to exert her full power instead of casting a Magical Power. If she does so, then she immediately casts the channelled version of the Banishment Magical Power, which cannot be resisted. Models may use Fate to prevent these Wounds individually as normal. However, immediately after casting the Banishment Magical Power in this way, place Galadriel prone and reduce her Will to 0. Additionally, for the rest of the battle, she does not benefit from her The Lady of Lothlórien and War Aspect special rules.
