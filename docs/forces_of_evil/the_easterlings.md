## THE EASTERLINGS

While it is true that many Men in Middle-earth were ever of good and noble heart, the same cannot be said for them all. Beyond the Sea of Rhun and the Iron Hills lies a vast empire of wicked Men known simply as the Easterlings. This catch-all term perhaps encompasses a great many warrior cultures, but few who have ventured past the Mountains of the East have returned to give a full account of their findings. The Easterlings were ever at odds with the Men of the West, and many believe this is due to some dire alliance with the Great Enemy - indeed, during the later years of the Third Age, the Easterlings launched vast invasions that threatened to cast down Gondor, and in the War of The Ring their warriors assailed both Minas Tirith and Erebor in colossal throngs.

The armies of the Easterlings are a truly impressive sight, for they are a host possessed of incredible martial discipline. Some say that the Easterlings clutch a blade to their chest even as they are weaned, while others say that warfare and the shedding of blood is akin to a rite of worship to their culture.

In battle they fight in deep phalanxes, bladed pikes presenting a wall of death behind which bronzed armour gleams in the wan sunlight. [Heavy armour]
- [Shield]s protect them from the foe, while their faces, even their gender, remain hidden, swathed in exotic fabrics and protected behind armoured helms. To the flanks ride the Kataphrakts, cavahymen whose horses wear heavy- scaled barding, in spite of the oppressive heat of their homeland - all the while Captains and War Priests exhort the ranks onwards into battle.

Among the Easterlings no name is better known than that of Khamul, second among the Nazgul. This fell warrior lord took one of the Nine Rings offered by the Dark Lord and though none can say for certain whether he was an Easterling then, he assuredly is now - his name spoken with reverence and fear by all within the Rhunish lands. Even the greatest warrior champions of Rhun, such as those who have risen to the heights of the knights of the Easterling warrior cults, and even the Dragon Emperor himself, bow to his irrepressible will.

## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Khamul the Easterling; Amdur, Lord of Blades; Easterling Dragon Knights; Easterling Captains; Easterling War Priests; Easterling Warriors and Easterling Kataphrakts.

The profile for Khamul the Easterling can be found on [page 135]. Khamul the Easterling counts as a Hero of Valour if taken as part of the Easterlings army list.

## ARMY BONUS

**"No quarter was asked..."** - Easterling models receive +1 Courage when their force is Broken. Additionally, once per game, in Scenarios in which a dice is rolled to see when the game ends, so long as there is at least one Easterling Hero model alive and on the battlefield, the Easterling player may choose to have the dice re-rolled if the Scenario ends before they wish it to.
