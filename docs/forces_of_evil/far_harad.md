## FAR HARAD

*To the south of Gondor, and even beyond Harad, lie the scorching deserts and barren wastes of Far Harad. The arid conditions are so harsh that even the majority of the Haradrim dare not venture too far south. Yet, the tribes of the Mahud, a savage warrior people fueled by tradition and superstition, thrive here, valuing warrior strength above all.*

*Mahud warriors, eschewing plans and tactics, charge into enemy ranks howling and brandishing bone clubs, daggers, and spears. Some flank their foes to dispatch them with poisoned darts fired from blowpipes with deadly accuracy. Many Mahud mount war camels, which can endure the intense heat, and charge into foes, impaling them on sharpened Mumak tusks attached to their mounts.*

*Mahud leaders, known as Tribesmasters, earn their position through acts of strength and brutality. A Tribesmaster who can unite several tribes may call himself a king, though this kingship is constantly challenged. The Mahud also have the unique ability to capture, control, and train Mumakil for war, using these massive creatures to devastating effect in battle.*

## ARMY COMPOSITION
