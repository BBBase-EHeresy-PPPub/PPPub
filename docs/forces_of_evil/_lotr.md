[***T***][***o the
east of the realm of Gondor lies a land of perpetual darkness, known as Mordor. The skies are filled with choking clouds of volcanic ash from the mountain of fire, and the very air is a poisonous fume. It is a barren and harsh land where only the strongest can hope to survive. It is within this blighted realm that the Dark Lord Sauron rose to power during the Second Age of
Middle-earth.***]

[*It was Sauron that gifted the rings of power to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth - three to the Elves, seven to the Dwarf lords and nine to the race of Men. However, these rings were no mere gifts, for Sauron forged in secret a master ring, to control all others. It was through this ring of power that Sauron aimed to see to the fall of the kingdoms of Middle-earth. Those of the race of Men who received these rings soon fell into darkness, their rings taking over their minds and transforming them into puppets of the Dark Lord. No longer the great Men they once were, these beings soon became part of the shadow realm - neither living nor
dead.*]

[*The ranks of Sauron's armies are made up of creatures bound to his will. Legions of Orc warriors swarm the plains of Mordor like ants, multiplying at a horrific speed and swelling the numbers of Sauron's forces. The bulk of these Orcs are the rank and
file*]

[*troops that Sauron will send directly into battle. Some Orcs have had some form of practice with their crude Orcish bows and fight at range. Some Orcs prefer to ride the vicious Wargs into battle, pouncing upon their enemies with unbridled ferocity and a constant lust for blood.*]

[*However, there are more than just Orcs within Sauron's ranks. There are some Men who bowed to Sauron willingly, turned to darkness by the promise of greatness and power. Foremost amongst these evil Men are the Black Numenoreans, elite fighters that form the vanguard of the armies of Mordor. Striding alongside the Men and Orcs of Mordor are the hulking Trolls, monstrous beasts whose muscular bodies are protected by thick scales and even thicker armour. Sent by Sauron to smash aside his enemies, the Trolls are one of the most fearsome creatures that Sauron
commands.*]

[*During the Battle of the Last Alliance, Sauron himself entered the fray in order to turn the tide of the battle. Smashing aside his enemies with his dreaded mace, Sauron marched through rank upon rank of Men and Elves, leaving death in his wake. Strengthened by his Ring of Power, Sauron slew both Gil-galad, the High King of Elves, and Elendil, the King of Men. Only by separating the Ring from its master could its power be
undone...*]

[ARMY COMPOSITION]

[*This army may include: The Dark Lord Sauron; The Witch- king of Angmar; Ringwraiths; Shelob; Orc
Captains;*]

[*Orc Shamans; Orc Taskmasters; Orc Drummers; Black Numenorean Marshalls; Mordor Troll Chieftains; Orc Warriors; Orc Trackers; Warg Riders; Black Numenoreans; Morgul Knights; Mordor Trolls; Mordor Siege Bows and Mordor War
Catapults.*]

[ARMY BONUS]

[*"The power of the Ring could not be undone" - Sauron's warband size is increased to 24. Additionally, a force that consists solely of models from the Barad-dur army list will never be considered Broken if Sauron has 3 or more Wounds remaining. Should Sauron have 2 or fewer Wounds remaining, the army will break as normal. Should Sauron be slain, the army will immediately count as being Broken.*]

[*Sauron is the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth and the Lord
of the Rings. His desire to conquer and rule is unending, and he will not stop until he has dominated all of Middle-earth. Totally
corrupt and driven by malice and cruelty, the Dark Lord wields his ultimate weapon, The One Ring. It is with this ring that Sauron
conquered much of Middle-earth during the Second Age, and with it in his possession, no realm is safe from the destruction that he will bring
upon them.*]

On a 2+, the power of the Ring sustains him and he has a single Wound restored. During the Fight phase, Sauron will make this roll for each Wound suffered that would cause him to be removed as a casualty. Sauron may use Might to influence this

[*The Witch-king is the greatest of the beings known as the Nazgul, and
is the Dark Lord's most deadly lieutenant. Robed in all-black, the Witch-king has long since forgotten the man he used to be before he
was gifted one of the rings of power. His very presence upon the battlefield fills his enemies with a sense of despair, one that makes
even the boldest of hearts tremble in terror. Among all the evils in Middle-earth, none, save Sauron himself, are more feared than the
Witch-king ofAngmar - the one they say no living Man can
kill.*]

[*Morgul Blade - Once per game, this model's controlling player may declare they are using their Morgul blade during the Fight phase before rolling To Wound. If a model is using a Morgul blade, they must direct all of their Strikes against a single target. An enemy that suffers a Wound from the Morgul blade is automatically slain, regardless of the number of Wounds on their profile. Heroes may use Fate to avoid these Wounds, but if even a single Wound is not saved, they are slain. If the model using the Morgul blade is mounted, they must use the rider's Attacks and Strength if using the Morgul
blade.*]

At his weakest, the Witch-king starts the game with no Might, no Fate and 10 points of Will, and costs 70 points. Each extra point of Might, Will or Fate costs an extra 5 points, so the Witch-king with 3 Might, 3 Fate and 20 Will points will cost 150 points, before any

[***T***][***here are
many barren and forsaken lands within Middle-earth, ruled by evil and plagued by ill fortune and foul creatures. The greatest of these is the kingdom ofAngmar in the north, for this cruel realm is the stronghold of the Witch-king, Sauron's chief servant and the lord of the
Nazgul.***]

[*It was from the realm ofAngmar that the Witch-king unleashed his fury upon the northern kingdoms of Middle-earth. So great were his armies that those who opposed him trembled in their cities. The Witch-king was able to use his dark powers to bind tortured spirits to his will, unleashing creatures of nightmare upon his foes. It was this fate that saw the once-great kingdom of Arnor fall into ruin. Hordes of Orcs marched upon the capital, Pornost, bringing destruction and death to the people there. Joined by ghostly spirits of lords and warriors past and twisted malignant apparitions bound to the will of the Witch-king, the armies of Angmar slaughtered all who opposed them.*]

[*Although he was eventually defeated and routed from his holds in the north, the Witch-king endured and his armies, though scattered, slowly sought to regroup. At the end of the Third Age there are still packs of Orcs and Wargs raiding and plundering
the*]

[*homesteads of the north, bands of Trolls roam the barren lands in search of fresh victims and there are whispers of unnatural beings lingering within the shadows of that fell
kingdom.*]

[*Within the ruins of the kingdom ofAngmar, spectres tempt travellers to their unsuspecting doom. Tortured spirits are still bound to the will of the Witch-king, for while he lives they can never be free, cursed to wander the forgotten highways of a realm long since abandoned. Barrow-wights hold court within the ruins of the halls they once ruled over. No longer the wise and noble rulers of old, they are now beings of evil and malice tasked with sacrificing those they find in the name of the Dark Lord. But there are greater terrors
still.*]

[*Hidden within the realm ofAngmar lies a great evil, a being that has survived countless centuries. That terror is Gulavhar, a demon of the ancient world. Quite how he survived the Ages of the world will never be known, yet it is likely that he was drawn to the northern realm by the ever-growing dark power of the Witch-king that emanates from Angmar's borders. Gulavhar now roams this land, ever eager to feast upon blood and sustain himself for ages to come.*]

all manner of living things are repelled by his very being. Vegetation withers, animals sicken and bold warriors cower

[***M***][***any
years have passed since Sauron's defeat at the hands of the Last Alliance, yet his evil was not vanquished forever. For since the Ring endured, so did Sauron's will. Atop his tower in Barad-dur, Sauron's gaze pierces all - a great eye wreathed in flame, lidless and ever watching. He has spent much of the Third Age regaining his former strength, secretly growing his armies into the formidable force they once were, that one day he might come forth from Mordor and reclaim The One
Ring.***]

[*At the time that the Ring of Power has awoken, the Nine have been sent forth from Minas Morgul in search of the Dark Lord's ultimate weapon, their sole purpose to locate its whereabouts and to kill the one who carries it. As Sauron's will has lost none of its potency, the Nine have been able to regain their strength, taking on the guise of the Black Riders - a truly terrifying sight that will chill the hearts of their enemies. Scouring the lands of Middle-earth, the Black Riders search both from horseback and from atop their Fell Beasts, terrifying creatures whose screech will freeze the hearts of even the boldest of
warriors.*]

[*Within the many strongholds of Mordor, the armies of Sauron have grown enormously. Minas Morgul now seethes with Orcs and other foul creatures, ready to burst forth and conquer the lands
outside*]

[*Mordor. The plains ofGorgoroth have been filled with countless evil beings, legions of Mordor Uruk-hai hunger to spill the blood of the Free Peoples and huge monstrous Trolls roam the plateau eager to cause the destruction that comes so naturally to
them.*]

[*In the north-west of Mordor looms the Black Gate, known as the Morannon, a huge fortification blocking the path into the black lands. Here reside the Morannon Orcs - stronger, better equipped and much more brutal than the mindless rabble that make up the bulk of Sauron's armies. The leader of the Morannon is Gothmog, a ruthless and barbaric Orc who possesses knowledge of battle tactics far beyond most Orcs and even Men. It is Gothmog that will lead Sauron's armies against Gondor, marching them to the walls of Minas Tirith late in the Third
Age.*]

[*Should any seek to strike out against him, however, it is not just Orcs that Sauron has at his disposal. High within the pass of Cirith Ungol dwells a hidden terror, Shelob, the child of Ungoliant. Sauron is quite content to leave Shelob at peace, for those who venture into her lair are seldom heard from
again.*]

[*It is these forces that Sauron intends to unleash upon Middle-earth in the dying years of the Third Age, for he is determined to regain The One Ring and finish the work he began millennia
ago.*]

Upon discovering the possessions of Frodo Baggins, Gorbag ends up embroiled in a murderous battle with Shagrat and his followers.

*At the start of any Priority phase, before any dice are rolled, Kardush
can drain the life force of a friendly Orc model within 6 ", causing it to
be removed as a casualty. Kardush then immediately regains D3 Will points. This cannot take his Will points above their starting level.*

*Whilst most Orc shamans practice a crude form of sorcery, Kardush is an exception to the norm. It is believed that Kardush was taught the ways of much more learned sorcery under the tutelage of one of the Nazgul - no doubt for their own twisted ends. However, this has left Kardush with abilities almost unique within Mordor's armies, allowing him to drain the life force of those nearby before unleashing it as a ball of flame.*

*Shadow Pawn **103 -** The Nazgul that taught Kardush his trade has no
doubt set him up as a sacrifice for his own cruel means.*

*At the start of any Priority phase, before any dice are rolled,
Kardush's controlling player can remove him from the board as a casualty to allow
a single friendly Ringwraith model within 6" to immediately regain D6
Will points. This cannot take the Ringwraith model's Will points above

[]{#bookmark444 .anchor}MORIA

***S****ince the fall of Khazad-dum and the death of Durin, the great Dwarven kingdom of Moria has fallen into ruin and now lies in the clutches of the vile Moria Goblins and the creatures under their control. The splendour of Moria is all but erased and the Dwarven city of Dwarrowdelf now lies crumbling and in darkness. Torches have been replaced with cobwebs and the mines resemble more of a tomb than a lord's hall.***

*The fate of Durin came at the fault of the Dwarves themselves, for in their efforts to continue to dig into the core of the mountain in search of precious material, they awoke something in the darkness. A demon from the ancient world wreathed in both shadow and flame; a Balrog ofMorgoth buried beneath Moria since the great wars of the First Age. This terrible foe slaughtered all of the Dwarves in its path before slaying the mighty Dwarf King and conquering Moria, leaving it to the mercy of the Goblins who ravaged and defiled the once great Dwarven realm. Should the Balrog ever be roused from its slumber again, it will take a being of comparable power to stop the evil it spreads.*

*Over the years since the fall of Moria, many Goblins have taken upon themselves the role of 'king', murdering and betraying their way to the top of the creatures' hierarchy. The greatest of these is Durburz, a Goblin king with more guile than any who came before him. Using the deceitfid skills of his followers, Durburz was able to work his way up to rule in Moria and silence any that opposed his leadership. Since then, Durburz has ruled the mountain halls with an iron fist, showing no mercy to those who would dare to stand against him.*

*The Goblins that have taken up residence within Moria's halls are a vile and cunning race. While they could not hope to match the Dwarves one-on-one, their superior numbers and ability to scale the walls and caverns with incredible dexterity meant that the Dwarves were often overwhelmed and unable to fend off their would-be attackers. When the hordes of Goblins were not enough to oust the Dwarven defenders, the task fell to the Moria Blackshields, a tougher and more vicious breed of Goblins that relishes the opportunity to tear into the ranks of the enemy to break armour and spill blood.*

ARMY COMPOSITION

*This army may include: The Balrog; Durburz, the Goblin King of Moria; Groblog; Druzhag the Beastcaller; Ashrak; Moria Goblin Captains; Moria Goblin Shamans; Moria Blackshield Captains; Moria Blackshield Shamans; Dragons; Cave Drakes; The Watcher in the Water; Moria Goblin Warriors; Moria Goblin Drums; Moria Blackshields; Moria Blackshield Dmmmers; Warg Marauders; Moria Goblin Prowlers; Bat Swarms; Cave Trolls and Dwellers in the Dark.*

*The profile for Cave Trolls can be found on page 131.*

ARMY BONUS
 *"We cannot get out, they are coming" - Friendly Moria Goblin models involved in a Fight where their opponent is Trapped receive a bonus of +1 to their Fight value.*

SPIRIT, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF LEGEND

*As the Dwarves of Moria delved deep in search of the riches that lay
beneath the mountains, they awoke something terrible in the darkness - shadow and flame. The Balrog came forth from its slumber, slaughtering
the Dwarves that had dared to rouse it. The Balrog even slew the noble Dwarf King, Durin, forever earning it the moniker of Durin's
Bane. This giant beast is formed of living fire and is one of the most deadly foes that any warrior could ever be faced with. Able to
conjure weapons of wicked flame, there is no mortal within Middle-earth that could ever hope to endure such a creature, and even those of
an older power would be sorely tested against its might should their paths ever cross.*

*Giant flaming sword and a fiery lash*

*Fiery lash - This is a throwing weapon with a range of 8" and a Strength of 7. Additionally, a model that is hit by this weapon and not slain is dragged directly towards and into base contact with the Balrog, even over intervening models or terrain. If the model cannot be placed where it should be placed, instead place it in base contact with the Balrog as close as possible to the position it should have been in. If, for whatever reason, the model cannot be placed anywhere in base contact, then it is not moved at all.*

SPECIAL RULES

*Ancient Evil, Fearless, Resistant to Magic, Terror.*

*Goblin Mastery - Such is the fear that the Balrog commands within the Goblins of Moria they will fight to ensure they do not feel its fiery wrath.*

*Flame of Udun - The Balrog is wreathed in flame, able to manifest weapons of sorcerous fire.*

*The Balrog is never considered to be unarmed and any model that suffers a Wound from the Balrog's Strikes (even if it is subsequently saved by Fate) and not slain must roll a D6. On a 6, the model suffers the Set Ablaze special rule. Additionally, the Balrog is immune to any fire-based attacks or special rules, such as a Dragon's Breathe Fire or the Set Ablaze special rule.*

*Demon of the Ancient World - A demon from a bygone age, the power that flows through the Balrog is a nigh unstoppable force.*

*The Balrog may call a Heroic Combat each turn without the need to expend a point of Might. Additionally, special rules and Strikes that would slay the Balrog instantly (such as Drain Soul or a Morgul blade) will only inflict half of the Balrog's starting Wounds rather than all of them.*

*Friendly Moria Goblin models within 12" of the Balrog automatically pass Courage tests.*

ASHRAK 55 POINTS

GOBLIN, MORIA, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF FORTITUDE

*Ashrdk was once bitten by a Venom-back spider, his fellow Goblins
abandoning him either out of fear or the knowledge that no Goblin ever survives such a venomous bite. Ashrdk, however, did not die. Instead,
the venom infused itself with his blood. Some say that this has made him much more powerful - providing him with an affinity with spiders. It
is even rumoured that he possesses the power to conceal his spider-kin in shadow.*

Possessing a crude and brutish form of magic, these shamans are capable of whipping their followers into a bloodthirsty frenzy, enabling them to suffer grievous wounds yet still carry on the fight.*

*The Shamans of the Blackshields have dabbled in a sorcery very different to that of their Moria counterparts.

DRAGON 250 POINTS

DRAGON, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF VALOUR

*Across the history of Middle-earth, there have been many stories of
these mythical creatures. Tales that have spread fear and dread across the land, tales of the great treasure hoard ofScatha, the destruction
ofSmaug and the fires spread by Ancalagon the Black. Dragons fight with a ferocity that most creatures cannot hope to match, their claws
can pierce metal and stone, and the snap of their jaws can cleave a man in two. Those that possess the ability to breathe fire can burn
whole settlements to ash in seconds. The hide of a Dragon is all but impenetrable, its scales impervious to arrows or swords that barely
even hope to scratch it, and to gaze into the sinister eyes of these creatures is to tempt bewitchment.*

Any model that suffers an unsaved Wound (Fate may still be taken) from a Dragon's Breathe Fire is automatically slain.*

CAVE DRAKE 150 POINTS

DRAKE, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO - MINOR HERO

*These scaled predators dwell within the bowels of the mountains of
Middle-earth. Fiercely territorial creatures, Cave Drakes will
ferociously defend their homes from intruders that threaten their young, slashing
and biting at those who disturb their nests without much care for who they may harm. This has made them natural enemies of the Dwarves who
are constantly delving deeper in search of precious gems and metals, often disturbing the nests of these creatures. A cornered
Cave Drake is even more vicious than usual, snapping its jaws and lashing its tail with frenzied ferocity in order to drive back those
that threaten it. In the heat of battle, Cave Drakes have even been
known to swallow warriors whole before continuing upon their territorial
rampage.*

*Fate rolls may be made against this Brutal Power Attack as if it has caused a Wound, but if a model fails to save this with Fate it will be slain.*

*Protect the Nest - A Cave Drake will viciously defend their young, viciously snapping and tearing at those that intrude upon their nest.*

*At the start of the game, before any models have been deployed, the Cave Drake's controlling player may place a single 25mm Nest marker per Cave Drake (the eggs that come in the Cave Drake set are ideal for this) anywhere on the board. Whilst within 3" of a Nest marker, a Cave Drake gains the Fearless special rule.*

THE WATCHER IN THE WATER 200 POINTS

KRAKEN, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO - INDEPENDENT HERO

*Outside the Westgate of Moria is a body of murky water containing
within its depths a creature of unfathomable terror - the Watcher in the Water. This ravenous and stealthy creature is covered in tentacles
that lash out to drag its victims into the depths. Silently watching from its hiding spot, the Watcher can strike with little or no warning.
Just how the Watcher got to the Westgate, or how long it has been there, is unknown. Yet it is certain that the creature hounded the
expedition of Balin to Moria as well as The Fellowship some years
later.*

SPECIAL RULES

*Harbinger of Evil, Resistant to Magic, Terror.*

*From the Deep **[Ml]{.underline} -** The Watcher lurks in the depths of
the waters, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.*

*The Watcher in the Water can never be part of another Hero model's warband. When you deploy your army, do not deploy the Watcher in the Water on the board - instead keep it to one side for later. During each Priority phase, after Priority has been rolled, announce if you would like the Watcher to arrive and if yes, roll a D6. On a 3+, the Watcher is ready to enter play. Once you have declared the Watcher is ready to enter, you must roll during each Priority phase thereafter until it is available.*

*When the Watcher is ready to enter play, immediately place it anywhere on the battlefield - it can displace models. Move any displaced models the minimum distance possible so that they are 1" away from the Watcher (or as close as this situation will allow). In this situation, players take it in turns to displace models, starting with the Watcher's controlling player. This may create some odd situations, but represents the Watcher bursting forth, scattering warriors both friend and foe alike. The Watcher cannot charge on the turn it arrives.*

*Many Tentacles **03 -** As the Watcher fights, it will lose a tentacle or two, each injury diminishing its threat.*

*Tentacles **El -** The Watcher lashes out with its tentacles, intent on securing itself a tasty morsel.*

*In the Shoot phase, the Watcher may make D6 shooting attacks. These have a range of 6" and a Strength of 3, and never require In The Way rolls. Any model hit by a tentacle, but not slain, is immediately dragged into base contact with the Watcher by the shortest route possible, even over the heads of other models. Models moved in this way do not count as having charged. If there is no way to fit the model in base contact, it is not moved at all. The Watcher can still make these shooting attacks even if it is Engaged in combat.*

*Water Dweller - A creature of the deep, the Watcher is much deadlier whilst within its natural habitat.*

*The Watcher is not slowed when entering a water feature. In fact, whilst within one, its Move value is doubled and it always counts as having rolled a 6 on the Swim chart. Additionally, if the Watcher charges whilst within a Water Feature, it gains the Monstrous Charge special mle.*

**BRU TAI PO[WER. AUAf]{.underline}K**

*a creature of the deep, and will readily drag those unfortunate enough to be caught within its slimy grasp to a watery grave.*

*Instead of striking normally, if the Watcher in the Water is within a water feature it can select a single Man-sized or smaller model involved in the same fight, and then roll a D6. On a 3+, that model suffers a Wound (Fate rolls can be made as usual). If the Wound is not saved, the model is dragged to the depths and immediately slain. The Watcher is then removed from the board and its controlling player will start to roll for the Watcher to re-arrive as described in the From the Deep special rule on this page.*

*When the Watcher is reduced to 3 or less Wounds remaining, its Attacks are also reduced to 3.*

FOR 2 MORIA GOBLIN DRUMMERS AND 1 DRUM

GOBLIN, MORIA, INFANTRY, WARRIOR

*The sound of the Goblin Drums heralds only doom and death to those
unfortunate to hear it. To the monotonous beat of the crudely fashioned drums the Moria Goblins scurry into battle, driven forth by
the constant rhythm. Whilst the sound of bone upon taut skin spurs the vile Goblins of Moria forward, the deathly sound strikes fear into

SPECIAL RULES

*Cave Dweller.*

*Destroying the Drum - The Drum can be shot at and struck normally, and has a Defence of 10 and 3 Wounds.*

*If it is reduced to 0 wounds, it is destroyed and cannot be played anymore. The Drum has no Control Zone and any enemy model that spends a full turn in base contact with the Drum, without doing anything else (such as shooting, using a Magical Power or fighting in combat), may immediately destroy the Drum as described above.*

*Take up the Drum [ESI]{.underline} - A Goblin Drum is an important
tool to the Moria hordes, should it cease playing then others will flock to take up the beat themselves.*

*If either of the Drummers are slain, they may pass on their wargear to any other unengaged Moria Goblin Warrior within 1" - immediately replace the model with the slain Drummer. Models that take up the Drummer's wargear will automatically drop any that they are carrying.*

*Drums in the Deep - A Moria Goblin Drum takes up two spaces within a warband and counts as two models towards the army. It is deployed in the same way as the rest of the warband.*

*For the Drum to be played, at least one Moria Goblin Drummer must have started the turn in base contact with the Drum, and also not be Engaged in a Fight. When the Drum is being played, it has the following effects:*

*All Fights within 18" of one or more Drums, that also include at least one friendly Moria Goblin model, may re-roll a single D6 for their Duel roll. Note that this is not cumulative with the effects of a banner.*

*All friendly Moria Goblin models on the battlefield add 1 to their Courage value, and all enemy models suffer a -1 penalty to their Courage value. Note that this is not cumulative with other rules that confer similar modifiers.*

*The Drum is a Heavy Object and as such is moved exactly like one. The Drum cannot be played in a turn in which it has moved.*

MORIA BLACKSHIELD DRUMMERS 75 POINTS

FOR 2 DRUMMERS, 1 WITH DRUM

GOBLIN, MORIA, INFANTRY, WARRIOR

*Marching alongside the Moria Blackshields are their drummers, whose
foreboding sounds herald the arrival of the Blackshield forces, and often the demise of their foes. The ominous and booming beat of the
drums is enough to put doubt in the hearts of even the most stalwart of Dwarven warrior, for few have heard the distinctive booming and lived
to tell the tale.*

SPECIAL RULES

*Cave Dweller, Hatred (Dwarf),*

*Run and Drum - Unlike the Drums employed by their lesser warriors, the Blackshields will run into the fray with the Drum strapped to the back of one of their number, whilst another beats upon it.*

*Take up the Drum **\|E0 -** To play or carry the Drum of the Blackshield is a sign of great importance, and so should the Drum fall, another Blackshield will readily take its place upon the battlefield.*

*If either the Drummer or the Drum Bearer is slain, they may pass on their wargear to any other unengaged Moria Blackshield within 1" - immediately replace the model with the slain Drummer or Drum Bearer. Models that take up the Dmmmer's wargear will automatically drop any that they are carrying.*

*The Drum is considered to be playing as long as the Dmmmer and the Dmm Bearer are in base contact with each other.*

*Doom! Doom! - When the Dmm is being played, it has the following effects:*

*All Fights within 12" of one or more Dmms, that also include at least one friendly Moria Goblin model, may re-roll a single D6 for their Duel roll. Note that this is not cumulative with the effects of a banner.*

*All friendly Moria Goblin models on the battlefield add 1 to their Courage value, and all enemy models suffer a -1 penalty to their Courage value. Note that this is not cumulative with other mles that confer similar modifiers.*

*There are some Goblins that thrive upon the idea of an unfair fight, preferring instead to dwell in the shadows and strike without being noticed. These Prowlers are often employed by aspiring Goblin kings to instill fear and loyalty, and squash any dissension within the Goblin ranks. Goblin Prowlers, although more skilled than their counterparts, are most deadly when they are able to outnumber and corner their intended victims.*

*Nesting within the caves of The Misty Mountains are swarms of vile and bloodthirsty bats that linger in the shadows, waiting for unfortunate passers-by. Whilst on their own they are little more than an annoyance, when they flock together they become a deadly black cloud. Those caught within the swarm are swiftly dispatched by a whirlwind of claws and teeth. If this was not enough, the appearance of these bat swarms is usually followed by an onslaught of Moria Goblins - if not something worse...*

WARG MARAUDER 30 POINTS

GOBLIN, WARG, MORIA, CAVALRY, WARRIOR

*Throughout the years, many pacts and alliances have been formed between
the Goblins of Moria and the Wild Wargs of The Misty Mountains. One of the benefits of such an alliance is the Goblins being
granted permission to ride into battle upon the backs of their Warg allies. These Warg Marauders are fearsome opponents, and both Goblins
and Warg benefit from this - the Goblins able to kill their foes more easily and the Warg getting exclusive feeding rights to any kills.*

*10" 3/5+ 4 4 112*

*A Warg Marauder is an interesting Cavalry model in that it has three Moria Goblins riding upon a single Warg, one with a shield and two with a bow. This model is treated the same as any other Cavalry model with the following exceptions:*

*Whilst the Goblin with a shield is still alive and mounted upon the Warg, all of the parts of the Cavalry model gain the bonus of + 1 to their Defence.*

*The Warg Marauder only counts as one model towards an army's Bow Limit.*

WARGEAR

*Armour, sword and either shield or Orc bow (Moria Goblins), Claws and teeth (Warg).*

SPECIAL RULES

*On the Hunt H\^J - From the back of their Warg, the Goblins of Moria are able to fire their bows in the hope of providing their canine transport with some much-desired flesh.*

*A Warg Marauder can always fire an Orc bow shot for each Goblin with an Orc bow that is alive upon the back of the Warg, even if it has moved its full movement or is Engaged in a Fight.*

*Lethal Union E^;^ - A Warg Marauder is much more deadly than the sum of its parts, a fact that the enemies of Moria are all too familiar with.*

*Whilst the Goblins remain mounted upon the Warg, the entire model gains the Terror special rule and adds a bonus of + 1 to its Courage value. Additionally, in combat a Warg Marauder may make an additional Attack for each Goblin after the first that is still mounted upon the Warg, so long as they did not shoot during the Shoot phase.*

DWELLER IN THE DARK 75 POINTS

SPIRIT, MONSTER, INFANTRY, WARRIOR

*Lurking within the depths of The Misty Mountains, fell creatures of
unspeakable evil dwell with a murderous intent. With an appearance similar to that of the Balrog, it has long been suspected that these
creatures are born of the same dark powers as Durin's Bane. Although smaller and less formidable than the Balrog, the Dwellers in the Dark
are nonetheless beings of dark power, using the life-force of their victims to replenish their strength and heal their wounds.*

[]{#bookmark492 .anchor}ISENGARD

***I****sengard is a mighty fortress sited to guard the Gap of Rohan, consisting of a formidable stone wall protecting the colossal***

***Tower of Orthanc. This gigantic edifice was perhaps one of the greatest towers in all of Middle-earth and it was here that Saruman the White settled, gifted the land by the Stewards of Gondor and with the blessing of Rohan. In return, the White Wizard pledged peace and friendship. Such words would, in later years, curdle and sour, for Saruman's nobility and wisdom was to be twisted to darker paths.***

*Although it had doubtless spent years fermenting, Isengard's treason was first unveiled when Saruman attempted to imprison Gandalf the Grey atop the Tower of Orthanc. It was a cruel act, to betray a friend and mock the just principles of the White Council, but in truth it was merely the first, and perhaps least, in a long list of calumnies the White Wizard would perpetrate. Under orders from the Dark Lord's agents, Saruman turned his vast intellect towards the forging of a new and deadly force within the bounds of Isengard, an army worthy of Mordor.*

*Around Orthanc the monstrous fires of industry blazed hot as weapons and armour were forged in vast quantities and, in dark pits cut deep into the ground, horrendous experiments were conducted by the White Wizard. Saruman's goal was to create*

*a new breed of warrior, crossing Orcs with Goblin-men. These Fighting Uruk-hai, as they would become known, would eventually prove to be one of the most formidable armies in the War of The Ring, for each Uruk was at least the height of a man and possessed an unnatural strength that meant they could run without wearying and fight with crushing power. Clad in crude but sturdy armour plates, the Uruk-hai were as resilient as any, save perhaps the distant armies of the Dwarves, and their fanatical devotion was equal to that of Men.*

*Before his vast legions were ready to march on Rohan in open war, Saruman wasted no time unleashing droves of scouts to search for the Ringbearer and to lay waste to Rohan's Westfold. Ravenous packs of Warg Riders swept across the rolling plains, wreaking devastation where they rode, while bands of scouting Uruk-hai, goaded on by bloodthirsty Captains, gave chase to The Fellowship of the Ring along the banks of the Anduin. Of course, the full horror of his master plan was unleashed as thousands of Uruk-hai swept across the Fords of Isen and arrived to besiege Helm's Deep in what would be one of the bloodiest and most decisive battles of the War of The Ring. There, beneath darkened skies and driving rain, the Fighting Uruk-hai would unleash their full fury and test their mettle in an effort to wipe the Kingdom of Rohan from the face of Middle-earth.*

SARUMAN 180 POINTS

WIZARD, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF LEGEND

*Once the leader of the Councils of the Wise, and the eponymous head of
the White Council, Saruman the White allowed himself to be corrupted by the persuasive powers of the Dark Lord as he gazed
jealously into the Palantir of Orthanc. In so doing he embarked on a road that would see him stripped of his nobility and twisted into a
treacherous parody of a true Istari. So aligned, he turned his
prodigious intellect to building an army to rival the Dark Lord's own. What
Saruman hoped to ultimately gain from his betrayal is shrouded in mystery, but he nonetheless used his magical knowledge against his
former friend Gandalf the Grey and, in a stroke, sentenced thousands to die by fire and sword as his legions invaded Rohan.*

*The Palantir - Although ultimately it enabled the Dark Lord to bind Saruman to his will, the Palantir of Orthanc also granted the White Wizard the ability to scry across great distances and discern things hitherto unknown to him.*

*Saruman's Stand Fast! has a range of 12" and, unlike other Hero models' Stand Fast! rolls, can affect other Hero models.*

*Lord of the Istari **E0 -** Before his treachery, Saruman was the most powerful of the five Wizards sent to Middle-earth. His treason did nothing to lessen his power.*

GRIMA WORMTONGUE 25 POINTS

MAN, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - INDEPENDENT HERO

*Grima is a man of Rohan who willingly sold his services to Saruman in
exchange for promises of wealth and power, a despicable act that saw him inveigle his way into the services of King Theoden where he
could cause the most harm. When Rohan's need for heroic leadership was greatest, the counsel of Grima was words of despair. So it was that
a lord of great promise was stripped of his will to act, sitting indolent and oblivious as the Westfold burned. Though he is no warrior,
Grima's strength lies in his ability to twist the words and thoughts of those around him, robbing even the wise of their heroism.*

***[M]{.underline} \_W [F ]{.underline}**500*

OPTIONS

*Horse 10 points*

SPECIAL RULES

*A Traitor Within [El]{.underline}i - Grima may be deployed in one of
two ways, either as part of the Isengard force or as part of an enemy's warband.*

*Grima must be deployed in Saruman's warband if deployed as part of the Isengard force.*

*Alternatively, before deployment begins, you may attach Grima to an enemy warband. When this warband is deployed or moves onto the battlefield, you must immediately place Grima afterwards as if he was a member of that warband. Grima is always controlled by his controlling player and moves and fights when it is his controlling player's turn to do so as usual.*

*If deployed as part of the enemy's army (but not as part of his own army), no enemy model can shoot at or strike blows against Grfma. Nor can they shoot if Grima is In The Way of the shot. Enemy models are allowed to Charge Grima and fight, but strike no blows if they win. Note that Grima can be targeted by Magical Powers - after all, it is Gandalf who roots out his wicked ways!*

*This restriction ends if Saruman is slain, if Grima voluntarily Charges an enemy model or if Grima scores a Wound with his dagger (even if the Wound is avoided with Fate). Grima can decide not to strike blows if he wins a Duel roll in order not to reveal his real allegiance. Once one of these conditions is met, the depth of Grima's evil is revealed and he becomes an enemy who can be shot at and fought in the same way as any other enemy model.*

*Wormtongue [llR\^]{.underline} - If an enemy Hero model is within 6" of Grima, 2 Might points must be expended to use Heroic Actions instead of 1.*

*A captain in Lurtz's raiding force, Ugluk takes command of the Uruk-hai Scouts after the ambush at Amon Hen, driving his warriors (and their Hobbit prisoners) onwards towards Isengard. Unflinching obedience to Saruman's orders is all that drives Ugluk onwards, and when Grishndkh's Orcs threaten his prisoners, Ugluk is swift to act, restoring order and loyalty within the ranks with a single sweep of his blade.*

*Riding Dagger - The curious blade Sharku carries into battle complements his gritty, vicious fighting style.*

*This is a dagger. Additionally, whenever an enemy Hero model in base contact resolves a Strike against Sharku and fails To Wound,
immediately resolve one Strength 4 Strike against that model.*

HEROIC ACTIONS

-   *Heroic March*

*The sly Orc known as Sharku was tasked by the White Wizard of Isengard with ranging deep into Rohan to sow panic and destruction. Such a mission suited this cruel Orc well, for Sharku delighted in riding down the weak and afraid, and allowing his Warg to feast on the fallen. Not that he was unwilling to fight armed warriors though. Indeed, Sharku's warband very nearly cost the realms of both Rohan and Gondor their kings.*

He will shoot at his target, regardless of other Uruks in the way, and such is his prowess, with both blade and crossbow, that none dare gainsay him.*

*Ahead of the bands of scouting Uruk-hai range Mauhur's Marauders, the swiftest and most eager of Isengard's scouting Uruk-hai. Mauhur is the leader of these warriors, and his reputation has been built upon his speed and his berserk frenzy in combat. With two scuffed and battered swords he unleashes an avalanche of hacking, slashing blows. No sooner has his first foe fallen, then he sets off after another, his baying war cry carrying ahead of him on the wind.*

*As the Uruk-hai march relentlessly into battle, they do so to the low thudding of the drums that accompany them. Uruk-hai Drummers are tasked with the important job of ensuring that the Uruks' pace does not falter, keeping them moving at the rapid speed that their master requires of them.*

*Unleashed from the pits ofOrthanc with a single mission, the Uruk-hai Scouts loyal to the White Hand were tasked with dragging the Ringbearer to the White Wizard. Stronger than Orcs and better able to resist the glare of the sun, these warriors were able to run for days on end and still fight with animalistic ferocity. Before long, raiding parties of Scouts also roved far into Rohan, laying waste to settlements and driving the Rohirrim from their homes.*

*Saruman's defection to the service of the Dark Lord left him with one monstrous obsession - to build an army worthy of Mordor. To that end, the beautiful grounds of Orthanc were reduced to the sprawl of industry as he had his new Orcish servants raise up an army of hideous creations, the Fighting Uruk-hai. Warriors as tall and broad as the mightiest of Men, resistant to sunlight and able to fight without tiring, these would be his weapon against the Free Peoples. Against Rohan, he unleashed Uruk-hai warriors by the thousand, clad in thick armour and armed with pikes, shields and crossbows made in the heinous forges beneath Isengard.*

*The most barbarous and brutal of the Uruk-hai are the Berserkers, frenzied killers who are hurled into battle to break through enemy lines and secure a foothold during sieges. Before they are unleashed, their helmets are filled with blood and then thrust roughly onto their head.

wins a Duel roll while fighting with its Berserker blade as a two-handed

URUK-HAI DEMOLITION TEAM 80 PQINTS

URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, WARRIOR

*It is not enough for Saruman that he has unleashed an army of thousands
against Helm's Deep - his plan is to destroy Rohan's greatest defence utterly. To that end, he has fabricated explosive charges which
can be detonated with devastating effect. A whispered treachery from Grima Wormtongue informing the White Wizard exactly where these
bombs will be most effective.*

COMPOSITION

*An Uruk-hai Demolition team has two Uruk-hai Warriors with swords, one Uruk-hai Berserker with a flaming brand and Berserker blade and one demolition charge (see below),*

OPTIONS

*Equip Uruk-hai Warrior with flaming brand 1 point*

*DEMOLITION CHARGES*

*The devilry of Saruman has created weapons of monstrous power. Any caught nearby when these demolition charges are ignited are likely to be blown to smithereens.*

*Moving the Charge - A demolition charge is a Heavy Object, as on page 110 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Rules Manual. It may never be carried by mounted models.*

*Detonating the Charge - To use the demolition charge it must be dropped. A model with a flaming brand in base contact with the charge, which is not also Engaged in combat, may attempt to set it off at the start of the Fight phase. The model attempting to set off the charge must pass a Courage test. If it fails, it cannot detonate the charge. If it succeeds, the Evil player rolls on the Detonation table to determine the effects.*

*When it explodes, a demolition charge automatically strikes everything within 2" of the model - gates, doors, and of course, any models (friend or foe) that are in range of it. Each target struck automatically takes D6 Wounds, regardless of its Defence value. Cavalry models take D6 hits on both the mount and the rider.*

*Desperate Detonations - Without a burning brand, causing a detonation is hard. Any model from the same army as the demolition charge may attempt a Desperate Detonation at the start of the Fight phase as long as it is in base contact and not Engaged in combat. It must also pass a Courage test as normal. For each model attempting this, roll a D6. If one or more 6s are rolled, the charge is detonated - roll on the Detonation table as usual.*

SPECIAL RULES

*Flaming Brands - Touching a flaming torch to one of Saruman's bombs takes a courage beyond sanity.*

*A model carrying a flaming brand cannot use a two-handed weapon (if it has one). If a model carrying a flaming brand is killed, the brand is extinguished and lost in the chaos of battle.*

*Attacking the Charge - The demolition charge can be shot at normally, and has a Defence of 7 and 3 Wounds. If the charge is wounded, roll a D6 per Wound inflicted. On a 6, the charge immediately detonates - roll on the Detonation table as normal.*

*A demolition charge that is wounded by another demolition charge will be detonated on the roll of a 4+ (per Wound suffered) rather than a 6.*

*If brought to 0 Wounds without exploding, the demolition charge is shattered and the powder scatters harmlessly on the ground - remove the charge from play.*

*An enemy model that spends a Fight phase in base contact with a demolition charge, and is not Engaged in combat, may automatically disable it. Remove it from play.*

DETONATION TABLE

*D6 RESULT*

1.  *Dud. The charge has been damaged in some way     and will not detonate; remove it from play.*
 *2‑5 Instant Reaction. The charge catches instantly, exploding in a roar of smoke and flame, as described previously.*

6.  *Titanic Explosion. The powder in the charge     detonates with colossal fury as described previously,     but inflicts 2D6 Wounds rather than D6.*

*The Uruk-hai army that besieged Helm's Deep was no mere rabble, but a
well-ordered host with weapons and wargear devised by the White Wizard himself. Assault Ballistae were wheeled into position to
fire massive bolts, easily twice the length of a man, over the battlements, behind which were dragged heavy ropes that enabled siege
ladders to be effortlessly raised. Of course, a weapon of such power is equally useful if aimed at the enemy, where the bolt can cut through
ranks of warriors or fell an Ent with a single hit.*

***Siege Engine Strength Defence Wounds***

*Ballista (9) 10 4*

CREW

*An Isengard Assault Ballista is a large Siege Engine and is crewed by three Uruk-hai warrior crew wearing heavy armour.

SPECIAL RULES

*Piercing Shot - If a shot from a Isengard Assault Ballista hits a Battlefield target, then they will suffer one single Strength 9 hit. Additionally, if the target has Strength 5 or lower, they will be knocked Prone and flung D6" directly away from the Ballista. Any model that the target passes over will also be knocked Prone and suffer one single Strength 6 hit. If the target comes into contact with a piece of impassable terrain, or a model that is Strength 6 or higher, then it will immediately stop and be knocked Prone, and both the target and the Obstacle or model (if it has a Defence value) will suffer one Strength 6 hit.*

*Raise the Ladders! Part weapon, part siege device, a carefully placed shot from the Assault Ballista can raise a siege ladder in an instant, and propel an Uruk-hai straight into combat.*

*The Assault Ballista can attempt to raise a ladder to the enemy battlements in the Shoot phase. To do this, the controlling player must first nominate a point on the battlements within range and which at least one crew member and the machine have Line of Sight to. Roll To Hit as usual - if a hit is scored, the grapple has struck home; if the machine misses, there is no further effect. When the grappling hook hits, a single siege ladder within 6" of the wall base below the target point is moved forwards to the wall and raised immediately. All ladder carriers drop their ladder as it is raised. Any one of the carriers can grab the top of the ladder and ride it to the top as it ascends. This model is then placed as if they had climbed to the top of the ladder that turn - which means that they count as charging into combat against a defender at the top of the tower if there is one. Furthermore, the defender will receive no benefit from defending an obstacle in the turn that a ladder is raised in this way..*

*Accurate - An Isengard Assault Ballista will only scatter 3" rather than 6".*

[]{#bookmark532 .anchor}THE EASTERLINGS

***W****hile it is true that many Men in Middle-earth were ever of good and noble heart, the same cannot be said for them all. Beyond the Sea of Rhun and the Iron Hills lies a vast empire of wicked Men known simply as the Easterlings. This catch-all term perhaps encompasses a great many warrior cultures, but few who have ventured past the Mountains of the East have returned to give a full account of their findings. The Easterlings were ever at odds with the Men of the West, and many believe this is due to some dire alliance with the Great Enemy - indeed, during the later years of the Third Age, the Easterlings launched vast invasions that threatened to cast down Gondor, and in the War of The Ring their warriors assailed both Minas Tirith and Erebor in colossal throngs.***

*The armies of the Easterlings are a truly impressive sight, for they are a host possessed of incredible martial discipline. Some say that the Easterlings clutch a blade to their chest even as they are weaned, while others say that warfare and the shedding of blood is akin to a rite of worship to their culture.*

*In battle they fight in deep phalanxes, bladed pikes presenting a wall of death behind which bronzed armour gleams in the wan sunlight. Heavy armour and shields protect them from the foe, while their faces, even their gender, remain hidden, swathed in exotic fabrics and protected behind armoured helms. To the flanks ride the Kataphrakts, cavahymen whose horses wear heavy- scaled barding, in spite of the oppressive heat of their homeland - all the while Captains and War Priests exhort the ranks onwards into battle.*

*Among the Easterlings no name is better known than that of Khamul, second among the Nazgul. This fell warrior lord took one of the Nine Rings offered by the Dark Lord and though none can say for certain whether he was an Easterling then, he assuredly is now - his name spoken with reverence and fear by all within the Rhunish lands. Even the greatest warrior champions of Rhun, such as those who have risen to the heights of the knights of the Easterling warrior cults, and even the Dragon Emperor himself, bow to his irrepressible will.*

ARMY COMPOSITION

*This army may include: Khamul the Easterling; Amdur, Lord of Blades; Easterling Dragon Knights; Easterling Captains; Easterling War Priests; Easterling Warriors and Easterling Kataphrakts.*

*The profile for Khamul the Easterling can be found on page 135. Khamul the Easterling counts as a Hero of Valour if taken as part of the Easterlings army list.*

ARMY BONUS

*"No quarter was asked..." - Easterling models receive + 1 Courage when their force is Broken. Additionally, once per game, in Scenarios in which a dice is rolled to see when the game ends, so long as there is at least one Easterling Hero model alive and on the battlefield, the Easterling player may choose to have the dice re-rolled if the Scenario ends before they wish it to.*

AMDUR, LORD OF BLADES 130 POINTS

MAN, EASTERLING, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF VALOUR

*Some say that Amdur is an orphan, raised from the gutter to join the
ranks of the vast armies of the Dragon Emperor, others that he is the son of a princeling who turned from a life of privilege to dedicate
himself to the art of the blade. What all who dwell east of the Sea of Rhun agree upon is that he is one of the greatest swordsmen among the
innumerable hordes sworn to Sauron's cause. It was Amdur who founded the order of Black Dragons which forms the elite vanguard of the
Easterling armies, and among the Dragon Knights his name is spoken with a mixture of reverence and fear.*

*In battle, Amdur is an island ofcalm amid the frenetic clamour of
swords, shields, drums and horns, making only small precise movements as he duels the foe, his dark eyes ever watchful, perceiving the efforts
of his enemy impassively. When it is time to strike, he does so with the speed of a viper, the keen edge of his sword effortlessly carving
through flesh and bone.*

*When the march on Gondor was ordered, Amdur readily joined, his fierce
pride demanding that he tried himself against the Lords of the West...*

EASTERLING DRAGON KNIGHT 65 POINTS

MAN, EASTERLING, INFANTRY, HERO - MINOR HERO

*The initiates of the Order of Dragon Knights are those Easterling
warriors who have dedicated their lives to mastering the martial arts, inspired by their exemplar, Amdur. In war shrines across Rhun, a lone
Dragon Knight will watch in silent contemplation as scores of Easterling warriors train ceaselessly in the hope of gaining the
attention of the Dragon Cult, and being raised to its ranks. Hundreds
of aspirants will show their skills to the knights who act as
shrine-keepers, but only a select few will be invited to remain and
commence their training in earnest. These initiates are the Black Dragons, tvho
will train under the Dragon Knights, just as they once learned from Amdur. Although their life is solitary by choice, and they only accept a
handful of warriors into their retinue, when the war call thunders across Rhun, the Dragon Knights answer.*

*The Easterlings have a strong martial code within their culture, and none are more revered than the warriors among them. Indeed, the slave markets teem with those deemed too weak to live among so fierce a people. The Captains are exemplars of the Easterling armies, capable leaders who can be trusted to follow their orders to the letter, no matter how callous or cruel. An Easterling warband whose Captain is slain in action will often be executed, as a reward for failure, ensuring that they will fight to protect their leader, even though they may secretly harbour a great disdain for them.*

*Long ago, the Easterlings swore dark oaths of fealty to Sauron, and although the centuries have ground inexorably onwards, they remain true to their allegiance. None can say quite what drove the Easterlings to worship the Dark Lord, but worship him they do - offering their lives readily on countless battlefields. Foremost among these devotees are the War Priests, who drive those around them into a battle frenzy, ignoring injuries or driving home sword strokes with unbelievable force. Some reason this is through fiery and religious fervour, others that it is by some dark magic... regardless, the result is the same.*

*Past the Sea ofRhun lie the lands ruled by the Easterlings, vast tracts uncharted by the Men of the West. Across the lands amass armies of fanatics sworn to the Dark Lord, and at the close of the Third Age, they ready themselves for war on a scale not seen since the first War of The Ring. Foremost among these armies are the Easterling Warriors, skilled fighters who are as devoted to the Dark Lord as they are cruel and unflinching in battle. While cowardly Orcs might quiver and flee, and Men less devoted to the cause may blanch at the task in hand, when the fighting is fiercest, the Easterlings can be found undertaking their murderous task with a sinister enthusiasm.*

Clad in gleaming scale, the Kataphrakts are as cruel in battle as their infantry comrades. Valuing shock tactics, they ride at the foe as quickly as possible, forming a wedge to drive into the enemy ranks. Pressed close together, so as to present a wall of armour that will deflect bow shots and bolts, the Kataphrakts ride in finely drilled close order, maintaining flawless discipline before smashing through the enemy ranks in an crash of metal.*

[]{#bookmark548 .anchor}VARI AGS OF KHAND

*To **the east of Middle-earth lies the fractious and war-torn land ofKhand, split into untold numbers of provinces, settlements and villages. These are all presided over by a host of kings and chiefs, each one having come to rule through ruthlessness, treachery and the acquisition of wealth, for in Khand, power lies with the ones who can best afford it, and loyalty is a commodity that can be bought or sold as if it were goods on a stall. Chieftains will often remain loyal to their kings, for it is they who ensure that the chiefs are kept rich and in turn that those under their command are paid; yet even this loyalty can be bought. More than once, an ambitious chieftain has amassed enough wealth to buy the allegiance of another in order to seize control of a Khandish province. However, should such treachery be uncovered, any Khandish King worth his salt will personally see that the conspirators are put to death in the slowest and most painful way their imagination can muster.***

*It is not just the kings and chiefs ofKhand that can buy the loyalty of these warriors. Often the rulers of nearby lands will pay the Khandish Kings handsomely for the use of their armies when they march to war against their foes in Gondor or other enemies of the Dark Lord, for the warriors ofKhand are stubborn and belligerent fighters that will refuse to back down even if they should be clearly*

*beaten, exhibiting a savage nature for which they are famed. Their horsemen are skilled riders, and will often form a flanking force to pick off scouts and those that stray too far from the safety of the rank and file. However, the most deadly force within the armies ofKhand are their chariots. Ridden by only the kings and their most loyal followers, the chariots are able to charge through ranks of enemies, leaving fields strewn with corpses in their devastating wake. With forces such as these at their disposal, it is of little wonder as to why the Khandish armies are in such high demand from those that wish to hire their services.*

*Unlike the Easterlings, who pledged themselves to the Dark Lord out of devotion, the kings ofKhand submitted to Sauron out of a sense of fear rather than loyalty. Even so, they fight for him in order to increase their wealth, for Khand's alliance to Mordor has proven highly profitable. Under the Dark Lord's command, the armies ofKhand have pillaged and plundered the outposts of Gondor, the settlements surrounding them and have even raided as far as distant Rohan. This has ensured that the coffers of the kings have vastly increased in size, buying their loyalty to the Great Eye. Although the great battle at the Pelennor promises to be the bloodiest in memory, the potential spoils of war are far too great for the Khandish to ignore.*

ARMY COMPOSITION

*This army may include: Khandish Kings; Khandish Chieftains; Khandish Warriors; Khandish Horsemen and Khandish Charioteers.*

ARMY BONUS

*The eastern land of Khand is divided into many smaller provinces; each ruled over and dominated by their own royal bloodline.

The mightiest warriors of the Khandish army, a Khandish King fights to claim wealth and power to protect his honour as a warrior king. The reign of a Khandish King is often short-lived, for the royal families hold many ambitious and devious relatives who wish to claim the throne for themselves.*

Often used to flank an enemy and pick off their scouts, these horsemen have perfected the art of selecting their targets carefully - picking off the weakest members to thin the enemy's ranks. It is these famed tactics that have made the horsemen of Khand's services a valuable asset, and those that wish to utilise these skilled riders will have to pay significantly for the privilege.*

*A Khandish Chariot is a mount that has the following profile and special rules:*

***Mv F S D A W C***

*10" 0 3 7 0 3 3*

*Defensive Bulwark EE\] - When an enemy model makes an In The Way roll to see if they hit either the rider or the mount, they will hit the Chariot on a 1-4 and the rider on a 5+. Additionally, when in combat, any model that wishes to Strike the rider must roll a D6. On a 1-4, the model must Strike the Chariot. On a 5+, they may Strike the rider.*

*The Chariot and Magic EESEI - Models with Magical Powers can use them on the Chariot, selecting either the Chariot itself or one of the crew members as the target. Magical Powers that affect multiple targets will automatically affect both the Chariot and its crew if in range of the model. Only by affecting the Driver will a Magical Power such as Transfix or Compel impede the Chariot's movement (thereby causing it to remain stationary or take a move as described by the Magical Power). Finally, Magical Powers such as Sorcerous Blast, Nature's Wrath and Call Winds will not move the Chariot or Knock it Prone, although they will still inflict any damage as detailed in the Magical Power's description.*

*Stable Platform - A model riding a Chariot can still fire a bow after moving its full distance.*

*Chariot Charge EEE3 - A Khandish Chariot has the Monstrous Charge special rule. Additionally, a Khandish Chariot is an unusual model and moves in the following way:*

-   *At the start of its Move phase, the controlling player may     pivot the Chariot up to 45°. When pivoting, the Chariot     may touch models or terrain. In the case of models, move     them out of the way by the shortest route possible. In     the case of terrain, move the Chariot away just enough to     complete its pivot.*

-   *The Chariot may then move up to 10" in a straight     line. After each full 3" the Chariot has moved, it may     pivot a further 45°.*

-   *Once the Chariot has pivoted to face its desired direction,     move it forwards the desired amount in a straight line,     ignoring enemy models' Control Zones. Any models     the Chariot comes into contact with whilst moving (not     pivoting) will suffer two Strength 4 hits. If the model is     slain, the Chariot may continue with its movement. Cavalry     models suffer two hits on both the rider and the mount. If     the rider survives but the mount is slain, the rider is thrown     and, after testing on the Thrown Rider chart, is placed in     base contact with the Chariot. Might may not be used to     affect the result of these hits. A Chariot that is affected by a     I leroic March may still inflict these hits as normal.*

-   *If the model the Chariot charged survives, the Chariot will     still gain the benefits of its Monstrous Charge special rule.*

-   *The Chariot may instead choose to forego its movement in     order to pivot to face any direction. If a Chariot is moved by     an enemy model, it may not pivot in this way.*

-   *A Khandish Chariot cannot jump obstacles that form a     physical barrier, such as hedges, walls, fences or rocks. They     may attempt to cross obstacles such as streams or gullies     if they wish, but if a 1 is rolled, the rider is automatically     thrown and the Chariot is destroyed.*

[]{#bookmark560 .anchor}THE SERPENT HORDE

***T****o the south of the kingdom of Gondor lies the arid desert wastes of Harad. Its barren lands are infested with serpents and scorpions, and the people that dwell there have become a hardy race out of necessity. Harad is far too vast to be ruled over from a single place, and so there are countless tribes and settlements, each with their own chief or lord presiding over them. Within the larger cities, wealthy kings command vast armies and rule with an iron fist, for to show any sign of weakness will only invite a challenge from ambitious rivals.***

*The Haradrim are a cruel race. Wars are constantly being fought between tribes as chieftains vie for power and land, with the victor claiming ownership over the loser's territory and slaying their enemies in cold blood. Many of the Haradrim will coat their weapons with a variety of vile and exotic toxins that induce a painful death for those unfortunate to be grazed even slightly by them. Upon the backs of their steeds, the Haradrim Raiders will pillage nearby settlements and carry out scouting attacks upon any Gondorian patrols that venture into the south.*

*The kings of the Haradrim possess much larger armies in comparison to the lowly tribal chieftains. Within the merchant city ofAbrakhdn, the wealth of the Golden King is substantial enough to buy him an army of Merchant Guards and ensure their unwavering loyalty to his rule. Upon the outskirts of the haunted*

*city of Kama, the mysterious Order of the Watchers exist. These warriors are in place to guard the people of Harad from what they believe the city holds within its walls. However, by far the greatest ruler in the land of Harad is the Serpent Lord himself, for Suladan commands an army unlike any another king could hope to muster, and the Serpent Guard protect their lord with their poisoned-tipped spears to ensure his safety.*

*The ancient Order of the Hdsharii has forever been a part of Haradrim culture, its shadowy agents watching over the Haradrim and ensuring that their plans are carried out to full effect. Acting as assassins, these skilled killers have often been employed by the lords and kings of Harad to seek out and silence any who would threaten their reign, and have even on occasion seen to end the tyrannical rule of a particular king should their removal be seen as something of interest to their Order.*

*However, the Haradrim's greatest weapons of war come in the form of the enormous Mumakil. These colossal beasts are tamed by the primitive Mahud tribes in the south and sold to the Haradrim for use in war. Capable of sweeping aside whole ranks of foes with one swing of their mighty tusks and with the legions of the Haradrim riding upon their howdahs, it is these beasts that confront the Rohirrim upon the fields of Pelennor and wreak terrible destruction on Theoden's people.*

ARMY COMPOSITION

*This army may include: Suladan the Serpent Lord; The Betrayer; The Golden King of Abrakhan; Hasharin; Haradrim Kings; Haradrim Chieftains; Haradrim Taskmasters; War Mumaks of Harad; Haradrim Warriors; Haradrim Raiders; Serpent Guard; Serpent Riders; Watchers of Kama and Abrakhan Merchant Guard.*

ARMY BONUS

*The Scorpion's Sting - A Serpent Horde army may have 50% of its warriors armed with bows. Additionally, all Haradrim Warriors and Raiders may apply the Poisoned Weapons special rule to all of their weapons.*

It was upon an escapade into the ruined city of Kama that Suladan stumbled across the fabled sword of King Mardat, the ruler who had once united the many tribes of the Haradrim against the hated descendants of Numenor. With this discovery, Suladan was able to claim himself as the Serpent Lord, once more reuniting Harad's various tribes in order to lead them upon the Pelennor.*

*Many of the kings that rule over the cities and settlements within Harad have stemmed from dynasties that have lasted an age, while others have simply killed the former king and declared themselves and their kin as the new royal family. In either situation, the kings that rule are both cunning and skilled warriors, who fight to further their reputation and ensure that their legacy endures.*

MAN, HARADRIM, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF VALOUR

*The merchant city of Ahrakhan is unlike any other found in the wastes
ofHarad. A prosperous, yet dangerous city that deals in trade of all kinds, Ahrakhan is ruled over by the Golden King. This merchant
ruler has earned his position through his vast wealth, for the Golden King is a man who has an incredible eye for profit and exploiting those
he can increase his wealth through. Although he may not share the same hatred for Gondor as many other Haradrim, the Golden King will
still march alongside the Golden Army of Ahrakhan upon the Pelennor, as it is clear to him that there is a highly profitable
outcome should victory be achieved.*

MUMAK, MONSTER, WAR BEAST, HERO - HERO OF FORTITUDE

*The colossal Mumakil are beasts trained by the Mahud and often gifted
to the chieftains and kings of Harad when the Mahud join them in war. These great beasts carry the Haradrim into war high up in their
howdahs, away from the raging battle below. Here the Haradrim can fire upon their enemies with both bow and falling rocks. A charging
Mumak is nigh unstoppable, smashing aside anything that stands in its path and leaving a trail of destruction in its massive lumbering
wake.*

*A War Mumak of Harad is comprised of a Haradrim Commander with armour and a war spear as the warband's captain, and the Mumak itself.*

*The Mumak has Defence 8 rather than 7.*

*Mahud Beastmaster Chieftain - The Mahud that ride these creatures have spent their lives training them and gaining a mastery over these beasts.*

*The Mahud Beastmaster Chieftain replaces the Haradrim Commander in all respects, including having the same Heroic Actions, except that the Mahud Beastmaster always stands on the forked wooden platform on the front of the Howdah. As he is crouched low upon the edges of the Howdah, the Mahud Beastmaster Chieftain counts as being in the Howdah for the purpose of In The Way rolls and any other effects that would affect models in the Howdah.*

*A Mahud Beastmaster Chieftain wears armour, and is equipped with a dagger and has the following profile:*

*Rocks - Some Mumakil are loaded with rocks that those in the howdah will throw at their foes upon the ground.*

*If they do not move, models in the Howdah may make a Shooting attack with a range of 8" and a Strength of 6.*

*Sigils of Defiance - It is said that the symbols and markings that the Haradrim paint onto the Mumakil provide protection from harm, as well as being able to nullify magical powers.*

*Models in the Howdah gain the Resistant to Magic special rule. Additionally, every time a model in the Howdah suffers a Wound, roll a D6. On a 6, the Wound is ignored exactly as if a point of Fate had been expended.*

*Those Haradrim that are less than willing to go to war are forcibly marched there under the whips of their imposing Taskmasters. These cruel men highlight the tribal nature of the Haradrim, lashing out at those that show hesitation upon their march to war. In fact, many Taskmasters actively seek out excuses to lash their fellows, showing great delight at each crack of their whip.*

These warriors will fight for their chieftain, yet the numbers that each leader can muster is entirely dependent upon their standing. The warriors that live in the merchant city of Abrakhan are fiercely loyal to their king, for under his rule they are well paid and therefore enforce his will. Those that dwell in the shadows of Kama, however, possess a much greater skill with a bow, for they must keep a watch upon the haunted city's borders for whatever may try to leave its walls.*

[]{#bookmark592 .anchor}FAR HARAD

***T****o the south of Gondor, and even Harad, lie the scorching deserts and barren wastes of Far Harad. Few can survive in such harsh and dry conditions, and even the majority of the Haradrim dare not venture too far south for fear of running out of water and succumbing to the heat. Yet in these arid conditions live the tribes of the Mahud, a savage warrior people fuelled by tradition and superstitions, who value a warrior's strength over anything else.***

*The Mahud themselves fight with little care for plans or tactics, preferring instead to charge head-first and howling into their enemy's ranks, brandishing bone clubs, daggers and spears, whilst others will flank their foe to kill them with poisoned darts fired through blowpipes used with deadly accuracy. Alongside those on foot, many Mahud will mount themselves upon war camels. These beasts are capable of enduring the immense heat that beats down upon the sands of Far Harad, where normal horses would collapse and die within days. These Mahud Raiders will careen into their foe with little thought for their own safety, impaling them upon the sharpened Mumak tusks they have crudely fastened to their mounts; their only goal is to show an abundance of great strength in their charge and lead the Mahud tribes to victory.*

*The Men that lead their tribes into battle earn their place as Tribesmaster through acts of great strength and brutality. Only the strongest and canniest warriors can claim such authority and it is they that will lead their tribes from the front in times of war. To lead a tribe requires strength, yet to lead several tribes takes not just strength but also the ability to fend off the attempts upon their life. Indeed, a Tribesmaster that can conquer the tribes around them can earn the right to call himself king, if only for a short time. No noble families exist in Far Harad, kingship is taken by those who are strong enough to not only possess it, but to keep it as well. The sole aim of the Mahud kings is to forge their names into legend through the collection of brutal victories and savage assaults upon their enemies.*

*Tire Mahud alone have developed the ability to capture, control and then train Mumakil for war. It is these beasts that provide the most fearsome impact in the armies of the Mahud, for their sheer size can strike terror into the hearts of their foes and their enormous bulk can smash through enemy warriors and fortifications alike. There is little doubt that if the Mahud ever ceased their constant wars and conflicts with each other, they would likely conquer great swathes of the lands to the north.*

ARMY COMPOSITION

*This army may include: Mahud Kings; Mahud Tribesmasters; War Mumaks of Far Harad; Mahud Warriors; Mahud Raiders and Half Trolls.*

ARMY BONUS

*Warrior Pride - Mahud Warrior models that are within 6" of a friendly Mahud Hero model that is Engaged in combat automatically pass all Courage tests they are required to make.*

*Most of the Tribesmasters of the Mahud control a single tribe and a small number of followers. On occasion, a particular Tribesmaster may end up dominating many tribes and large portions of land through their strength and dominance over their people. These fearsome warriors tvill declare themselves as king and will aggressively defend their right to rule from any who challenge it, surrounding themselves with powerful Tribesmasters, for a king to show weakness within the Mahud tribes is to invite conflict upon themselves.*

*The Mahud have dwelt in the far south of Middle-earth for countless years. These savage tribespeople are a primitive and superstitious race, yet this makes them all the more vicious in a fight. The Mahud tribes will rarely trouble themselves with tactics or battle plans, instead they charge directly towards their enemies, brandishing crude weapons made from rock and bone. Their greatest asset, however, comes in the form of their blowpipes, weapons they can use with great accuracy and that fire darts laced with a lethal toxin.*

![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image349.jpeg)![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image350.jpeg)

*The scorching heat of the deserts of Far Harad makes the horses ridden by the likes of the Haradrim unsuitable steeds for the Mahud. Instead, they prefer to ride war camels into battle, stubborn creatures that can easily cope with the arid wastelands of the far south. The Mahud strap sharpened splinters ofMumak tusks to the sides of their war camels, making a charge from these creatures all the more devastating.*

OPTIONS

*Half Trolls are an unusual folk, and it is believed by many of the Mahud that there is actual Troll blood running through their veins. While the merit of this has never been tested, with their ugly appearance, inability to speak and freakish strength, it is easy to see how the Mahud tribes have come to this conclusion. The exceptional strength possessed by these creatures can splinter shields and shatter swords, making the chance of parrying their blows nigh-on impossible. As strength is held in high regard within the MahPd tribes, the Half Trolls hold a special place within Mahud culture - their lack of the wits or cunning needed to fully rise to power assuring their acceptance by the Mahud kings and Tribesmasters.*

***T****he coastal city of Umbar is a squalid mass of humanity, its dark alleyways and shadowy docksides playing host to treacherous and unsavoury dealings. Those that dwell amid Umbar's destitution care little for the lives of others, concerned only with grasping a greater share. Corruption runs rife within the city, with almost all of the city's politics taking place in the shadows and dark places. It is whispered that the lords and figureheads who, on the surface, seem to run the city, are firmly in the pocket of the Hdsharii, the ancient Order that now bends Umbar to its own unknown, dark purposes.***

*The fleets of Umbar are feared in coastal towns the length of Middle-earth, for the corsairs that man the great black-sailed ships are among the most accomplished seamen and cruellest villains of the Third Age. Sailing up the coasts of Condor, plundering villages and sacking cities, they take whatever they desire from the settlements they attack, their huge black-sailed boats groaning with riches and their bow wave presaged by the miserable cries of the slaves that are crammed into their bowels.*

*Should a city prove to be more difficult than the unprotected coastal settlements the Corsairs prefer to attack, they will unleash the broken-minded Reavers upon their foes. Under the commanding bellows of the Corsair Bo'suns, the Corsair Reavers are driven into a mad frenzy, slashing at anything that lays in their path and leaving*

*mangled corpses in their wake. More than once this has turned out to be their own crewmembers, not that the Reavers would notice - even if they did, they would likely not care.*

*Those that command the Corsair fleets are cunning and ruthless seamen, former crewmembers who successfully led a mutiny upon their unfortunate predecessor when they showed but a moment of iveakness. Because of this, a captain must remain strong - there are always more ambitious crew longing to become the captain of their own ship, so that they can claim the wealth that goes with the rank. At the first sign of rebellion, a Captain must punish mutineers violently, ensuring the rest of their crew remain in fear of their
rule.*

*At the head of the fleets of Umbar stands the mysterious Dalamyr. This shadowy man was seemingly gifted the position of Fleetmaster - a rarity within Umbar as positions are usually taken, not given. Yet he has held onto it with little competition, mainly due to the fact that those that challenge his leadership are swiftly dispatched in a whirl of flashing steel blades before they can even sense they are in danger. Whilst the past of the Fleetmaster is quietly debated in crew quarters and dockside taverns, many have at least cottoned on to the fact that Dalamyr was, and most likely still is, a high ranking member of the Hdsharii. It is with this knowledge that Dalamyr's rule remains largely unchallenged, for few would ever knowingly go against the will of the Haradrim assassins.*

*Formerly a member of the shadowy Order of the Hdsharii, Dalamyr has been placed in control of the fleets of Umbar - no doubt for his Order's own twisted means. As Umbar's foremost Fleetmaster, Dalamyr has considerable power and influence over the city, using the subtle art of 'persuasion' he learned from the Hdsharii to influence the arduous politics of Umbar to suit his will. Commanding the Corsairs of Umbar, Dalamyr will often accompany them in plundering and pillaging the coastal towns and cities of Gondor to ensure that the will of his shadowed overlords is done.*

*Only the most ruthless of the Corsairs are able to seize the honour of captaining their own ship. These captains must be constantly prepared to fend off the challenges of their crew, as mutinies are commonplace as the captains gain the largest share of any plunder. However, the captains of the Corsair fleet are more than capable of fighting back against their would-be mutineers, for they themselves earned their place as captain through the very same treacherous acts.*

HEROES OF THE CORSAIRS OF UMBAR

***Mv F S D A W C MWF***

*6\* 5/3+ 4 4 3 2 4 W0*

WARGEAR

*Sword, throwing daggers and smoke bombs.*

*Smoke Bombs - These are a throwing weapon with Strength 1. Any model hit, but not slain, by these weapons must immediately expend a point of Will or be subjected to the effects of the Channelled version
of the Transfix Magical Power. Should Dalamyr ever roll a 1 To Hit with
his smoke bombs then his supply has run out and he cannot use them for the remainder of the game.*

HEROIC ACTIONS

-   *Heroic Strike*

-   *Heroic Defence*

SPECIAL RULES

Bane of Kings, Stalk Unseen.

*Preternatural Agility **13323 -** To corner a Hasharin is almost
impossible to accomplish, and those that do are often felled by a whirl of poisonous
steel blades.*

*Dalamyr can never be Trapped whilst still standing.*

HEROIC ACTIONS

-   *Heroic March*

OPTIONS

*Bow 5 points*

*Crossbow 5 points*

*Shield 5 points*

*Two-handed axe 5 points*

*Any good captain requires a strong Bo'sun to restore order and keep potential troublemakers at bay. The commanding voice of these Bo'suns is often enough to quell any thoughts of mutiny, for few Corsairs are brave enough to stand up against their brute strength. A captain must ensure that his Bo'sun is well paid and content, for he will be acutely aware that the man in charge of keeping his crew in check will also have one eye upon control of the ship.*

*Spear . 1 point*

SPECIAL RULES
 *Commanding Bellow **ES!2 -** The booming voice of a Corsair Bo'sun is enough to spur on the rabble around him, for few would wish to feel the Bo'sun's wrath.*
*Friendly Corsair models within 3" of a Corsair Bo'sun count as being in range of a banner.*

WARRIORS OF THE CORSAIRS OF UMBAR

![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image355.jpeg)CORSAIR OF UMBAR 7 POINTS

MAN, CORSAIR, INFANTRY, WARRIOR
 ***Mv F S D A W C **6" 4/4+ 33113*

WARGEAR

*Sword and throwing daggers.*

OPTIONS

*Bow ...,..., 1 point*

*Shield 1 point*

*Spear . . 1 point*

*Those that crew the fleets of Umbar are no more than cut-throats, out to score plunder from the raids that they embark on. They fight with a viciousness seldom seen within the race of Men as they raid the towns and cities along the coasts of Condor. Despite their ferocity, Corsair raids are brief, as they prefer to return to their ships quickly to enjoy the spoils of their plunder.*

![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image356.jpeg)![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image357.jpeg)

*Years upon the seas of Middle-earth plundering and pillaging at will has led to some Corsairs becoming bloodthirsty killers, having been driven mad by war. These reavers care not who feels the cold steel of their blades, so long as they are able to drive them through flesh of some kind. Corsair Reavers are usually kept chained up below deck to avoid any unfortunate 'accidents' happening to the crew.*

CORSAIR REAVER 9 POINTS

MAN, CORSAIR, INFANTRY, WARRIOR

***Mv F S D A W C***

*6" 4/4+ 3 3 2 1 4*

WARGEAR

*Two swords.*

SPECIAL RULES

*Mindless Killers - Without the commanding voice of their Bo'suns to keep them in check, a Corsair Reaver's lust for blood would drive them
to attack the nearest living thing - friend or foe.*

*Any Corsair Reaver that starts its move at least 6" away from a
friendly Corsair Bo'sun must take a Courage test. If the test is failed, they
will be driven into a bloodthirsty rampage, and will Charge the nearest enemy model. If two or more models are an equal distance away from each other then the Reaver's controlling player may choose which model the Reaver will Charge. If a Reaver fails this Courage test, and it is not possible
for it to Charge an enemy model, it will Charge the nearest friendly model
instead. Should a Corsair Reaver Charge a friendly model, then the Charged model may not move during the Move phase and must fight the Reaver during the Fight phase. If a Reaver fails this test, and there are no
models (friend or foe) that it can Charge, it will move 6" towards the
closest enemy model instead.*

*The Reaver's controlling player may choose to have the Reaver automatically fail this Courage test if they wish. When driven into this bloodthirsty rampage, Corsair Reavers gain a bonus of+1 to any To Wound rolls and do not need to take Courage tests for charging Terror-causing models.*

CORSAIR ARBALESTER

10 POINTS

MAN, CORSAIR, INFANTRY, WARRIOR

***Mv F S D A W C***

*6" 4/4+ 3 3 113*

WARGEAR

*Crossbow, dagger and pavise.*

*Pavise - This giant wooden shield provides the bearer +3 Defence, so long as the bearer is not Engaged in combat with another model. The bearer may use the rules for shielding, although they will not gain the
+1 Defence bonus as they also carry a crossbow.*

*As the black-sailed ships pull alongside the hulls of their conquests, it is the Corsair Arbalesters that make the first strikes against the crew. From behind their wooden pavises, the Arbalesters pepper the enemy crew with a flurry of crossbow bolts, allowing for the remainder of the Corsair crew to board unchallenged and claim the ship for their own. It is commonplace for the Corsair Arbalesters to place hefty wagers before raids begin as to who can score the most hits upon the enemy crew.*

SHARKEY'S ROGUES

*By **the time Sharkey's invasion of The Shire began, it was clear how far the Wizard who once called himself***

***Saruman the White had fallen. The former member of the Istari had gathered to him bands of vagabonds and bullies who were all too willing to join his planned suppression of the little folk, and when they arrived, they did so with shocking brutality.***

*The Shirelings had ever been a peaceful people, and they were wholly unprepared to withstand mannish thuggery. In a short time, roving patrols of ruffians had bullied the populace into compliance, rounding up and beating any who resisted. There is little doubt that these Men would have been swept away by a well-organised militia, but no such thing existed within the borders of The Shire, and only the Bounders, the Tooklanders and a few courageous souls*

*offered any serious resistance. For how could Hobbit-folk hope to triumph against Men who carried clubs, knives and bows to enforce their threats?*

*By the time Sharkey arrived, fleeing the sacking of Isengard, the Shire existed as an occupied land, its populace terrified into subservience, and for a short time he ruled it from Bag End as 'The Chief. Those who spoke out against Sharkey were consigned to the lockholes, and the Tooklanders were kept at bay with frequent, often bloody, skirmishes. Compared to the scale of the vast battles of the War of The Ring, these clashes may have seemed inconsequential, but for those involved it was a matter of life or death... and when an army of thugs and bullies is at large, life is precious indeed.*

ARMY COMPOSITION

*This army may include: Sharkey; Worm and Ruffians.*

ARMY BONUS
 *"You do what Sharkey says." - Sharkey's Stand Fast! affects the entire battlefield. Additionally, a force (or allied contingent) that contains models solely from the Sharkey's Rogues list may include warbands of 10-12 Ruffians without the need for a Hero to lead them.*
*In these warbands, nominate a single Warrior model within the warband as the captain for the purposes of deployment, etc.*

SPECIAL RULES

*Broken Loyalties - Worm is still under the control of Sharkey, unable to free himself from his service. Yet should Sharkey be exposed for who he really is, Worm will no doubt seek revenge for the terrible way the Wizard has treated him.*

*The Chief Q9I - Sharkey must always be the warband's Leader. Worm will always be the first follower in Sharkey's warband.*

*If Sharkey is reduced to 1 Wound and has no Fate remaining, Worm becomes an enemy model and must move towards and attack Sharkey if possible. If Sharkey is slain, Worm reverts to being a friendly model.*

SHARKEY AND WORM 60 POINTS FOR BOTH

WIZARD AND MAN, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF LEGEND

*The Scouring of The Shire was perpetrated at the whim (and under the
orders) of none other than Saruman ofOrthanc, albeit a Saruman whose power had been greatly reduced following his defeat by the Ents
and chastisement from Gandalf the White. With an army of bullies and malcontents to answer his bidding, Sharkey, as he became known, was
a force far greater than the Shirelings had the power to resist. At his heel loped the wretched Worm, a fallen Man of Rohan, whose
depraved condition had led him to murder. Vile though he was, there hid within Worm the potential to commit one final just deed.*

*WORM*

***Mv F S D A W C **6" 2/4+ 33112*

WARGEAR

*Dagger.*

*Whoever Strikes me shall be Accursed **S3 -** After a model resolves Strikes against Sharkey, it must take a Courage test. If the test is failed, that model takes one Strength 4 hit.*

*When he Sneaks **EE3 -** When eyes are elsewhere, Worm skulks about, doing his master's murderous bidding.*

*When making a Duel roll for a Fight where Worm is Engaged, check to see if any enemy models, except for those he is fighting, can see him. If only the model(s) Worm is fighting can see him, immediately increase his Fight value to 4 and his Attacks to 3 for the Duel roll and any Strikes that may follow.*

WARRIORS OF SHARKEY'S ROGUES

![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image361.jpeg)

RUFFIAN 5 POINTS

MAN, RUFFIAN, INFANTRY, WARRIOR

*The bullies and scoundrels that flocked to Sharkey's call to invade
The Shire could be considered among the worst examples of the race of Men, for their hearts were filled with greed for that which others had
earned and bitterness towards the joy of those around them. This manifested itself cruelly in the way in which they swiftly and violently
oppressed the Hobbits. With relish, the Ruffians seized vittles for the Chiefs storehouse and dragged away anyone who dared to break one of
Sharkey's countless rules. Though any disciplined army, or even a patrol of fighting Men from Gondor, Rohan or distant Dale would quickly
have routed them, the peaceful Hobbits were ill-prepared to face the lash of the whips, cudgels and knives arrayed against them.*

***Mv F S D A W C***

*6" 2/5+ 33112*

WARGEAR

*Knife or club.*

OPTIONS

*Bow 1 point*

*Whip 1 point*

SPECIAL RULES

*At 'em Lads! **ESQ -** The Ruffians aren't afraid of getting their hands dirty in a fight, especially when they think their foe is weaker than they are.*

*A Ruffian that is Engaged in a Fight that involves 1 or more Hobbit models gains a bonus of +1 to its Fight value.*

*Additionally, instead of making Strikes, when a Ruffian wins a Fight against a Hobbit model, they may attempt to bind it in chains. Nominate one Hobbit model from the Fight and roll a D6 - if the score is higher than the target's Strength, the model is bound. Treat it as though it has been affected by the Paralyse Magical Power.*
