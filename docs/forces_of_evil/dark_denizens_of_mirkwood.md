## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: The Spider Queen; Mirkwood Spiders; Giant Spiders; Bat Swarms and Fell Wargs.

The profile for Fell Wargs can be found on page 107.

## ARMY BONUS

**Beasts of Mirkwood** – So long as your army includes the Spider Queen, warbands composed entirely of Warg models do not need a Hero to lead them if they number six or more models; warbands composed entirely of Spider models do not need a Hero to lead them if they number two or more models; and warbands composed of a mixture of models do not need a Hero to lead them if they number ten or more models. Instead, one Warrior within the warband takes on the role of the warband's captain for the purpose of deployment.

A Mirkwood Spider can shoot webs at its enemies. They are treated as a throwing weapon with a range of 8". If a Mirkwood Spider hits its target, do not roll To Wound. Instead, the model suffers the effects of the Paralyse Magical Power. A Hero model hit by a Spider Web can choose to expend a Fate point in the same manner as if it had just suffered a Wound in order to dodge the attack. If successful, the target model is not Paralysed.
