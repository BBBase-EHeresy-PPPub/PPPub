**SPECIAL RULES**

- **Mindless Killers (ACTIVE)**

Any Corsair Reaver that starts its move at least 6" away from a friendly Corsair Bo'sun must take a Courage test. If the test is failed, they will be driven into a bloodthirsty rampage, and will Charge the nearest enemy model. If two or more models are an equal distance away from each other then the Reaver's controlling player may choose which model the Reaver will Charge. If a Reaver fails this Courage test, and it is not possible for it to Charge an enemy model, it will Charge the nearest friendly model instead. Should a Corsair Reaver Charge a friendly model, then the Charged model may not move during the Move phase and must fight the Reaver during the Fight phase. If a Reaver fails this test, and there are no models (friend or foe) that it can Charge, it will move 6" towards the closest enemy model instead.

The Reaver's controlling player may choose to have the Reaver automatically fail this Courage test if they wish. When driven into this bloodthirsty rampage, Corsair Reavers gain a bonus of +1 to any To Wound rolls and do not need to take Courage tests for charging Terror-causing models.
