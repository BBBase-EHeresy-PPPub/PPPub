## SHARKEY'S ROGUES

By the time Sharkey's invasion of The Shire began, it was clear how far the Wizard who once called himself Saruman the White had fallen. The former member of the Istari had gathered to him bands of vagabonds and bullies who were all too willing to join his planned suppression of the little folk, and when they arrived, they did so with shocking brutality.

The Shirelings had ever been a peaceful people, and they were wholly unprepared to withstand mannish thuggery. In a short time, roving patrols of ruffians had bullied the populace into compliance, rounding up and beating any who resisted. There is little doubt that these Men would have been swept away by a well-organised militia, but no such thing existed within the borders of The Shire, and only the Bounders, the Tooklanders and a few courageous souls offered any serious resistance. For how could Hobbit-folk hope to triumph against Men who carried clubs, knives and bows to enforce their threats?

By the time Sharkey arrived, fleeing the sacking of Isengard, the Shire existed as an occupied land, its populace terrified into subservience, and for a short time he ruled it from Bag End as 'The Chief. Those who spoke out against Sharkey were consigned to the lockholes, and the Tooklanders were kept at bay with frequent, often bloody, skirmishes. Compared to the scale of the vast battles of the War of The Ring, these clashes may have seemed inconsequential, but for those involved it was a matter of life or death... and when an army of thugs and bullies is at large, life is precious indeed.

## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Sharkey; Worm and Ruffians.

## ARMY BONUS

**"You do what Sharkey says."** - Sharkey's Stand Fast! affects the entire battlefield. Additionally, a force (or allied contingent) that contains models solely from the Sharkey's Rogues list may include warbands of 10-12 Ruffians without the need for a Hero to lead them. In these warbands, nominate a single Warrior model within the warband as the captain for the purposes of deployment, etc.

### SHARKEY AND WORM [60 POINTS FOR BOTH]
*WIZARD AND MAN, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF LEGEND*

| Mv | F  | S | D | A | W | C |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6" | 4/4+ | 4 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 4 |

**MAGICAL POWERS**

- Immobilise
- Terrifying Aura

  | Range | Casting |
  |:-----:|:-------:|
  |  12"  |   3+    |

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **Broken Loyalties:** Worm is still under the control of Sharkey, unable to free himself from his service. Yet should Sharkey be exposed for who he really is, Worm will no doubt seek revenge for the terrible way the Wizard has treated him.
- **The Chief:** Sharkey must always be the warband's Leader. Worm will always be the first follower in Sharkey's warband. If Sharkey is reduced to 1 Wound and has no Fate remaining, Worm becomes an enemy model and must move towards and attack Sharkey if possible. If Sharkey is slain, Worm reverts to being a friendly model.

**WORM**

| Mv | F  | S | D | A | W | C |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6" | 2/4+ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 2 |

**WARGEAR**

- Dagger

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **Whoever Strikes me shall be Accursed:** After a model resolves Strikes against Sharkey, it must take a Courage test. If the test is failed, that model takes one Strength 4 hit.
- **When he Sneaks:** When eyes are elsewhere, Worm skulks about, doing his master's murderous bidding. When making a Duel roll for a Fight where Worm is Engaged, check to see if any enemy models, except for those he is fighting, can see him. If only the model(s) Worm is fighting can see him, immediately increase his Fight value to 4 and his Attacks to 3 for the Duel roll and any Strikes that may follow.

<div class="unitCard" markdown>

### RUFFIAN [5 POINTS]
*MAN, RUFFIAN, INFANTRY, WARRIOR*

| Mv | F  | S | D | A | W | C |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6" | 2/5+ | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 2 |

**WARGEAR**

- Knife or club

**OPTIONS**

- Bow: 1 point
- Whip: 1 point

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **At 'em Lads!:** The Ruffians aren't afraid of getting their hands dirty in a fight, especially when they think their foe is weaker than they are. A Ruffian that is Engaged in a Fight that involves 1 or more Hobbit models gains a bonus of +1 to its Fight value. Additionally, instead of making Strikes, when a Ruffian wins a Fight against a Hobbit model, they may attempt to bind it in chains. Nominate one Hobbit model from the Fight and roll a D6 - if the score is higher than the target's Strength, the model is bound. Treat it as though it has been affected by the Paralyse Magical Power.
