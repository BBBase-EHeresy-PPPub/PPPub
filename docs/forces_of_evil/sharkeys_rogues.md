## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Sharkey; Worm and Ruffians.

## ARMY BONUS

**"You do what Sharkey says."** - Sharkey's [Stand Fast!] affects the entire battlefield. Additionally, a force (or allied contingent) that contains models solely from the Sharkey's Rogues list may include warbands of 10-12 Ruffians without the need for a Hero to lead them. In these warbands, nominate a single Warrior model within the warband as the captain for the purposes of deployment, etc.

- **When he Sneaks (ACTIVE)** 

When making a Duel roll for a Fight where Worm is Engaged, check to see if any enemy models, except for those he is fighting, can see him. If only the model(s) Worm is fighting can see him, immediately increase his Fight value to 4 and his Attacks to 3 for the Duel roll and any Strikes that may follow.

A Ruffian that is Engaged in a Fight that involves 1 or more Hobbit models gains a bonus of +1 to its Fight value.

Additionally, instead of making Strikes, when a Ruffian wins a Fight against a Hobbit model, they may attempt to bind it in chains. Nominate one Hobbit model from the Fight and roll a D6 - if the score is higher than the target's Strength, the model is bound. Treat it as though it has been affected by the Paralyse Magical Power.
