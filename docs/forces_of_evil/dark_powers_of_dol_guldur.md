## DARK POWERS OF DOL GULDUR

*Dol Guldur was once a stronghold of Sauron while he was under the guise of the Necromancer. Abandoned during the Third Age, a darkness has begun to spread from its crumbling walls in recent years. A sickness has descended upon the Greenwood, now known as Mirkwood, where nothing good grows anymore.*

*Within the ruins, the Necromancer has returned, building his strength to unleash his power against the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. With the One Ring, Sauron could bring devastation upon Middle-earth and cast it into shadow. From Dol Guldur, Sauron intends to orchestrate his hunt for the Ring.*

*To his side, Sauron has summoned his most deadly servants, the Nazgûl, clad in spiked armor and wielding deadly weaponry, alongside the tortured spirits known as the Castellans of Dol Guldur. These forces will lead Sauron's hunt for The One Ring.*

*The monstrous Keeper of the Dungeons takes delight in maiming and torturing those held in Dol Guldur's cells, tasked with retrieving the Rings of Power to locate The One Ring.*

*Legions of Orcs, including feral Hunter Orcs and vicious Gundabad Orcs, prepare for wars yet to come, drawn to the darkness of Dol Guldur.*
