**HEROIC ACTIONS**

- [Heroic Challenge]

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Ancient Evil]
- [Fearless]
- [Fly]
- [Resistant to Magic]
- [Terror]
- **Breathe Fire** `ACTIVE`

Smaug must expend a point of Will to Breathe Fire. Treat Smaug's fiery breath as a bow with a range of 18". If the shot hits, the target and all models (friendly or enemy) within 2" of the target suffer from the Set Ablaze special rule, though the immediate hit these models suffer is Strength 10 instead of Strength 9. Cavalry models suffer these hits on both the rider and the mount. Fate rolls may be taken as normal to prevent wounds, but any model that suffers a wound from Smaug's fiery breath is
automatically slain.

- ***Desolator of the North** `PASSIVE`

Smaug may expend a single point of Will each turn without depleting his own store. Furthermore, Smaug re-rolls To Wound rolls of 1 when making Strikes against Dwarf models.

- **Immovable Object** `PASSIVE`

Smaug cannot be Knocked to the Ground or otherwise moved against his will, and never Backs Away if he loses a Fight – his opponents must Back Away, even if they win! As a result of this, Smaug can never be Trapped.

- **Missing Scale** `PASSIVE`

If a model rolls a natural 6 To Hit Smaug with a shooting attack, then makes a successful roll To Wound, Smaug suffers a number of wounds equal to the Strength value of the missile weapon used by the shooting model.

- **Unstoppable Momentum** `ACTIVE`

If Smaug Charges into combat and wins the ensuing Fight, all of his opponents are Knocked to the Ground, regardless of their size (except a War Mumak of Harad, Iron Hills Chariot, or any model that can never be knocked Prone). Furthermore, should Smaug choose to make a Barge Brutal Power Attack, any models forced to Back Away also suffer a Strength 9 hit.
