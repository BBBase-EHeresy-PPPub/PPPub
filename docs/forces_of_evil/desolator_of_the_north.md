## DESOLATOR OF THE NORTH

*In the ages gone by, somewhere within the mountains to the north of Middle-earth, dwelt the great Fire-drakes, striking fear into the hearts of any who heard their roar. Among these, Smaug was the most feared and famous Fire-drake.*

*With the destruction of the cities of Dale and Erebor, Smaug became a legendary wyrm. Under Thrór, the treasure of Erebor grew, drawing Smaug to its riches. He first set the city of Dale ablaze, defeating its defenders and killing Girion, the lord of the city. Then, Smaug claimed The Lonely Mountain and its treasures, forcing Thrór and his kin to flee and establishing himself as King Under the Mountain.*
