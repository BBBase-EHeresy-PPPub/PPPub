## THE SERPENT HORDE

To the south of the kingdom of Gondor lies the arid desert wastes of Harad. Its barren lands are infested with serpents and scorpions, and the people that dwell there have become a hardy race out of necessity. Harad is far too vast to be ruled over from a single place, and so there are countless tribes and settlements, each with their own chief or lord presiding over them. Within the larger cities, wealthy kings command vast armies and rule with an iron fist, for to show any sign of weakness will only invite a challenge from ambitious rivals.

The Haradrim are a cruel race. Wars are constantly being fought between tribes as chieftains vie for power and land, with the victor claiming ownership over the loser's territory and slaying their enemies in cold blood. Many of the Haradrim will coat their weapons with a variety of vile and exotic toxins that induce a painful death for those unfortunate to be grazed even slightly by them. Upon the backs of their steeds, the Haradrim Raiders will pillage nearby settlements and carry out scouting attacks upon any Gondorian patrols that venture into the south.

The kings of the Haradrim possess much larger armies in comparison to the lowly tribal chieftains. Within the merchant city of Abrakhan, the wealth of the Golden King is substantial enough to buy him an army of Merchant Guards and ensure their unwavering loyalty to his rule. Upon the outskirts of the haunted city of Kama, the mysterious Order of the Watchers exist. These warriors are in place to guard the people of Harad from what they believe the city holds within its walls. However, by far the greatest ruler in the land of Harad is the Serpent Lord himself, for Suladan commands an army unlike any another king could hope to muster, and the Serpent Guard protect their lord with their poisoned-tipped spears to ensure his safety.

The ancient Order of the Hdsharii has forever been a part of Haradrim culture, its shadowy agents watching over the Haradrim and ensuring that their plans are carried out to full effect. Acting as assassins, these skilled killers have often been employed by the lords and kings of Harad to seek out and silence any who would threaten their reign, and have even on occasion seen to end the tyrannical rule of a particular king should their removal be seen as something of interest to their Order.

However, the Haradrim's greatest weapons of war come in the form of the enormous Mumakil. These colossal beasts are tamed by the primitive Mahud tribes in the south and sold to the Haradrim for use in war. Capable of sweeping aside whole ranks of foes with one swing of their mighty tusks and with the legions of the Haradrim riding upon their howdahs, it is these beasts that confront the Rohirrim upon the fields of Pelennor and wreak terrible destruction on Theoden's people.

### ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Suladan the Serpent Lord; The Betrayer; The Golden King of Abrakhan; Hasharin; Haradrim Kings; Haradrim Chieftains; Haradrim Taskmasters; War Mumaks of Harad; Haradrim Warriors; Haradrim Raiders; Serpent Guard; Serpent Riders; Watchers of Kama and Abrakhan Merchant Guard.

### ARMY BONUS

**"The Scorpion's Sting"** - A Serpent Horde army may have 50% of its warriors armed with bows. Additionally, all Haradrim Warriors and Raiders may apply the Poisoned Weapons special rule to all of their weapons.

The profile for The Betrayer can be found on [page 140]. The Betrayer counts as a Hero of Valour if taken as part of a The Serpent Horde army list.

### HEROIC ACTIONS

- Heroic Resolve
- Heroic March
- Heroic Strike
- Heroic Challenge

The general of the Serpent Horde, and arguably the greatest leader in the history of Harad, Suladan was already a fearsome warlord before coming into his own. It was upon an escapade into the ruined city of Kama that Suladan stumbled across the fabled sword of King Mardat, the ruler who had once united the many tribes of the Haradrim against the hated descendants of Numenor. With this discovery, Suladan was able to claim himself as the Serpent Lord, once more reuniting Harad's various tribes in order to lead them upon the Pelennor.

Many of the kings that rule over the cities and settlements within Harad have stemmed from dynasties that have lasted an age, while others have simply killed the former king and declared themselves and their kin as the new royal family. In either situation, the kings that rule are both cunning and skilled warriors, who fight to further their reputation and ensure that their legacy endures.
