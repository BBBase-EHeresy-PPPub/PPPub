- Sigils of Defiance: 20 points
- Tusk Weapons: 20 points
- Foul Temperament: 15 points
- Rappelling Lines: 10 points

- **Gnarled Hide**

The Mumak has Defence 8 rather than 7.

- **Mahud Beastmaster Chieftain** 

The Mahud Beastmaster Chieftain replaces the Haradrim Commander in all respects, including having the same Heroic Actions, except that the Mahud Beastmaster always stands on the forked wooden platform on the front of the Howdah. As he is crouched low upon the edges of the Howdah, the Mahud Beastmaster Chieftain counts as being in the Howdah for the purpose of In The Way rolls and any other effects that would affect models in the Howdah.

A Mahud Beastmaster Chieftain wears [armour], and is equipped with a [Dagger] and has the following profile:

| Mv | F  | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 6" | 4/3+ | 5 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 5 | 3  | 2  | 2 |


- **Foul Temperament**

This Mumak has its Attacks increased to 4, however, it will suffer a -1 penalty to all Courage tests when rolling to see whether or not it will Stampede.

- **Rappelling Lines**

Models in the Howdah may attempt to dismount from the Mumak during the Move phase, after the Mumak has moved. Roll a D6 for each model that is attempting to dismount. On a 1, the rope has snapped and the unfortunate model suffers falling damage as normal. On a 2+, the model successfully dismounts, place it in base contact with the Mumak. Models that dismount may still Charge as normal, although they may not make shooting attacks.

- **Rocks** 

If they do not move, models in the Howdah may make a Shooting attack with a range of 8" and a Strength of 6.

- **Sigils of Defiance** 

Models in the Howdah gain the Resistant to Magic special rule. Additionally, every time a model in the Howdah suffers a Wound, roll a D6. On a 6, the Wound is ignored exactly as if a point of Fate had been expended.

- **Tusk Weapons**

A Mumak with Tusk Weapons will inflict four Strength 9 hits when it Tramples, rather than three. 

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Terror]
- **Trample** 

When a War Mumak of Harad tramples, it will inflict three Strength 9 hits.

- **Awesome Presence (PASSIVE)**

Friendly Haradrim and Mahud models within 3" of this model may re-roll a single D6 when making a Duel roll. This is cumulative with the effects of a banner, however, each D6 may only be re-rolled once.
