## VARIAGS OF KHAND

The eastern land of Khand is a tumultuous region, fractured into numerous provinces each overseen by its own king or chief. Here, power is purchased with wealth, and loyalty is a commodity traded among the ambitious and ruthless. The kings ensure their chieftains are well-compensated, fostering a loyalty that is often ephemeral; ambitious chieftains can turn on their liege by amassing wealth to usurp a throne, and should their treachery be discovered, a gruesome end is ensured.

The Khandish warriors are notorious for their fierce tenacity in battle, renowned not only for their horsemen who expertly flank their foes but also for their devastating chariots. These chariots, typically manned by kings and their loyalists, can tear through enemy lines with deadly efficiency. The strategic use of these formidable units makes Khandish armies highly sought after by external rulers, particularly for campaigns against Gondor and allies of the Dark Lord.

Unlike the Easterlings who are bound by devotion to Sauron, the kings of Khand pledged allegiance out of fear and greed. Their armies, under the Dark Lord's command, have reaped considerable wealth from raids across Gondor and even distant Rohan, thus securing their loyalty to Mordor's cause.
