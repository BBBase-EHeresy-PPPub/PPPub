- **Defensive Bulwark** `ACTIVE`

When an enemy model makes an In The Way roll to see if they hit either the rider or the mount, they will hit the Chariot on a 1-4 and the rider on a 5+. Additionally, when in combat, any model that wishes to Strike the rider must roll a D6. On a 1-4, the model must Strike the Chariot. On a 5+, they may Strike the rider.

- **The Chariot and Magic** `PASSIVE`

Models with Magical Powers can use them on the Chariot, selecting either the Chariot itself or one of the crew members as the target. Magical Powers that affect multiple targets will automatically affect both the Chariot and its crew if in range of the model. Only by affecting the Driver will a Magical Power such as Transfix or Compel impede the Chariot's movement (thereby causing it to remain stationary or take a move as described by the Magical Power). Finally, Magical Powers such as Sorcerous Blast, Nature's Wrath and Call Winds will not move the Chariot or Knock it Prone, although they will still inflict any damage as detailed in the Magical Power's description.

- **Stable Platform** `ACTIVE`

A model riding a Chariot can still fire a bow after moving its full distance.

- Chariot Charge (ACTIVE)

A Khandish Chariot has the Monstrous Charge special rule. Additionally, a Khandish Chariot is an unusual model and moves in the following way:

•	At the start of its Move phase, the controlling player may pivot the Chariot up to 45°. When pivoting, the Chariot may touch models or terrain. In the case of models, move them out of the way by the shortest route possible. In the case of terrain, move the Chariot away just enough to complete its pivot.

•	The Chariot may then move up to 10" in a straight line. After each full 3" the Chariot has moved, it may pivot a further 45°.

•	Once the Chariot has pivoted to face its desired direction, move it forwards the desired amount in a straight line, ignoring enemy models' Control Zones. Any models the Chariot comes into contact with whilst moving (not pivoting) will suffer two Strength 4 hits. If the model is slain, the Chariot may continue with its movement. Cavalry models suffer two hits on both the rider and the mount. If the rider survives but the mount is slain, the rider is thrown and, after testing on the Thrown Rider chart, is placed in base contact with the Chariot. Might may not be used to affect the result of these hits. A Chariot that is affected by a Heroic March may still inflict these hits as normal.

•	If the model the Chariot charged survives, the Chariot will still gain the benefits of its Monstrous Charge special rule.

•	The Chariot may instead choose to forego its movement in order to pivot to face any direction. If a Chariot is moved by an enemy model, it may not pivot in this way.

•	A Khandish Chariot cannot jump obstacles that form a physical barrier, such as hedges, walls, fences or rocks. They may attempt to cross obstacles such as streams or gullies if they wish, but if a 1 is rolled, the rider is automatically thrown and the Chariot is destroyed.
