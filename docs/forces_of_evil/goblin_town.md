When the Goblin King Charges into combat, he can pass 'through’ friendly Goblin models when he moves. Each Goblin he moves through suffers a Strength 3 hit. Any Goblin that he ends his move on is automatically slain. A model with this special rule cannot be Compelled/Commanded over friendly models if it is forced to Charge as a part of that Magical Power.

- **Blubbery Mass (PASSIVE)**

Every time the Goblin King is wounded, roll a D6. On a 3+, the Wound is ignored. Magical Powers and Elven-made weapons ignore this ability.

- **Goblin Projectile (ACTIVE)**

In the Shoot phase, if there is a friendly Goblin model in base contact with the Goblin King, and neither are Engaged in combat, the Goblin King may make a shooting attack with a range of 12" – this counts as a throwing weapon. Remove the Goblin, roll To Hit and take any In The Way tests for the shooting attack. The shot is resolved at Strength 8 and will automatically knock Prone any model it hits.
