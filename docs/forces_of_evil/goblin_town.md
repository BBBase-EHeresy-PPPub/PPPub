## GOBLIN-TOWN

*Deep within the caverns of The Misty Mountains lies Goblin-town, a kingdom built by Goblins themselves out of rickety wooden walkways and structures made from the bones of their prisoners. Ruled by the grotesque Goblin King, this kingdom is a place of torture and malice, where the Goblins craft weapons from scraps of metal and the bones of their enemies.*

*Goblin-town is not just home to Goblins; it also harbors darker beings, such as a creature with a relic of immense power. This creature, unbeknownst to him, holds a small trinket that, when it falls into the possession of Bilbo Baggins, will shape the future of Middle-earth forever.*

## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: The Goblin King; Grinnah; The Goblin Scribe; Gollum; Goblin Captains; Goblin Mercenary Captains; Goblin Warriors; and Goblin Mercenaries.

## ARMY BONUS

"Down down down in Goblin-town" — Each Goblin Hero model may increase their maximum warband size by six models.
