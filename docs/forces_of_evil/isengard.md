### GRIMA WORMTONGUE [25 POINTS]
*MAN, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - INDEPENDENT HERO*

|  Mv  |  F   |  S  |  D  |  A  |  W  |  C  | M | W | F |
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-: | :-: | :-: |

**WARGEAR**

- [Dagger]

**OPTIONS**

- [Horse]: 10 points

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **A Traitor Within (PASSIVE)**

Grima must be deployed in Saruman's warband if deployed as part of the Isengard force.

Alternatively, before deployment begins, you may attach Grima to an enemy warband. When this warband is deployed or moves onto the battlefield, you must immediately place Grima afterwards as if he was a member of that warband. Grima is always controlled by his controlling player and moves and fights when it is his controlling player's turn to do so as usual.

If deployed as part of the enemy's army (but not as part of his own army), no enemy model can shoot at or strike blows against Grima. Nor can they shoot if Grima is In The Way of the shot. Enemy models are allowed to Charge Grima and fight, but strike no blows if they win. Note that Grima can be targeted by Magical Powers - after all, it is Gandalf who roots out his wicked ways!

This restriction ends if Saruman is slain, if Grima voluntarily Charges an enemy model or if Grima scores a Wound with his dagger (even if the Wound is avoided with Fate). Grima can decide not to strike blows if he wins a Duel roll in order not to reveal his real allegiance. Once one of these conditions is met, the depth of Grima's evil is revealed and he becomes an enemy who can be shot at and fought in the same way as any other enemy model.

- **Wormtongue (PASSIVE)**

If an enemy Hero model is within 6" of Grima, 2 Might points must be expended to use Heroic Actions instead of 1.

### URUK-HAI DEMOLITION TEAM [80 POINTS]
*URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, WARRIOR*

**COMPOSITION**

- An Uruk-hai Demolition team has two Uruk-hai Warriors with swords, one Uruk-hai Berserker with a flaming brand and Berserker blade and one demolition charge (see below),

**OPTIONS**

- Equip Uruk-hai Warrior with flaming brand: 1 point

**DEMOLITION CHARGES**

- **Moving the Charge**

A demolition charge is a Heavy Object, as on page 110 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Rules Manual. It may never be carried by mounted models.

- **Detonating the Charge**

To use the demolition charge it must be dropped. A model with a flaming brand in base contact with the charge, which is not also Engaged in combat, may attempt to set it off at the start of the Fight phase. The model attempting to set off the charge must pass a Courage test. If it fails, it cannot detonate the charge. If it succeeds, the Evil player rolls on the Detonation table to determine the effects.

When it explodes, a demolition charge automatically strikes everything within 2" of the model - gates, doors, and of course, any models (friend or foe) that are in range of it. Each target struck automatically takes D6 Wounds, regardless of its Defence value. Cavalry models take D6 hits on both the mount and the rider.

- **Desperate Detonations**

Without a burning brand, causing a detonation is hard. Any model from the same army as the demolition charge may attempt a Desperate Detonation at the start of the Fight phase as long as it is in base contact and not Engaged in combat. It must also pass a Courage test as normal. For each model attempting this, roll a D6. If one or more 6s are rolled, the charge is detonated - roll on the Detonation table as usual.

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **Flaming Brands**

A model carrying a flaming brand cannot use a two-handed weapon (if it has one). If a model carrying a flaming brand is killed, the brand is extinguished and lost in the chaos of battle.

- **Attacking the Charge**

The demolition charge can be shot at normally, and has a Defence of 7 and 3 Wounds. If the charge is wounded, roll a D6 per Wound inflicted. On a 6, the charge immediately detonates - roll on the Detonation table as normal.

A demolition charge that is wounded by another demolition charge will be detonated on the roll of a 4+ (per Wound suffered) rather than a 6.

If brought to 0 Wounds without exploding, the demolition charge is shattered and the powder scatters harmlessly on the ground - remove the charge from play.

An enemy model that spends a Fight phase in base contact with a demolition charge, and is not Engaged in combat, may automatically disable it. Remove it from play.

**DETONATION TABLE**

| D6 | RESULT                                                                                                      |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Dud. The charge has been damaged in some way and will not detonate; remove it from play.                   |
| 2-5| Instant Reaction. The charge catches instantly, exploding in a roar of smoke and flame, as described previously. |
| 6  | Titanic Explosion. The powder in the charge detonates with colossal fury as described previously, but inflicts 2D6 Wounds rather than D6. |

### ISENGARD ASSAULT BALLISTA [65 POINTS]
**SIEGE ENGINE**

| Siege Engine | Strength | Defence | Wounds |
|--------------|----------|---------|--------|
| Ballista  |    (9)    |    10    |    4   |

**CREW**

An Isengard Assault Ballista is a large Siege Engine and is crewed by three Uruk-hai warrior crew wearing heavy armour. One is armed with a [Sword], one a dagger and the other carries an Assault Ballista bolt (pike). Any additional crew purchased will be equipped with [Heavy armour] a [Sword]. One of the crew is automatically the [Siege Veteran]. All crew members have the *Uruk-hai, Isengard, Infantry and Warrior* keywords.

|  Mv  |  F   |  S  |  D  |  A  |  W  |  C  |
|:----:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  6"  | 4/4+ |  4  |  5  |  1  |  1  |  3  |

**OPTIONS**

- Uruk-hai Engineer Captain: 50 points
- Additional Crew: 9 points each
- Superior Construction: 15 points

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **Piercing Shot**

If a shot from an Isengard Assault Ballista hits a Battlefield target, then they will suffer one single Strength 9 hit. Additionally, if the target has Strength 5 or lower, they will be knocked Prone and flung D6" directly away from the Ballista. Any model that the target passes over will also be knocked Prone and suffer one single Strength 6 hit. If the target comes into contact with a piece of impassable terrain, or a model that is Strength 6 or higher, then it will immediately stop and be knocked Prone, and both the target and the Obstacle or model (if it has a Defence value) will suffer one Strength 6 hit.

- **Raise the Ladders!**

The Assault Ballista can attempt to raise a ladder to the enemy battlements in the Shoot phase. To do this, the controlling player must first nominate a point on the battlements within range and which at least one crew member and the machine have Line of Sight to. Roll To Hit as usual - if a hit is scored, the grapple has struck home; if the machine misses, there is no further effect. When the grappling hook hits, a single siege ladder within 6" of the wall base below the target point is moved forwards to the wall and raised immediately. All ladder carriers drop their ladder as it is raised. Any one of the carriers can grab the top of the ladder and ride it to the top as it ascends. This model is then placed as if they had climbed to the top of the ladder that turn - which means that they count as charging into combat against a defender at the top of the tower if there is one. Furthermore, the defender will receive no benefit from defending an obstacle in the turn that a ladder is raised in this way..

- **Accurate**

An Isengard Assault Ballista will only scatter 3" rather than 6".
