## ISENGARD

**Isengard** is a mighty fortress sited to guard the Gap of Rohan, consisting of a formidable stone wall protecting the colossal **Tower of Orthanc**. This gigantic edifice was perhaps one of the greatest towers in all of Middle-earth and it was here that Saruman the White settled, gifted the land by the Stewards of Gondor and with the blessing of Rohan. In return, the White Wizard pledged peace and friendship. Such words would, in later years, curdle and sour, for Saruman's nobility and wisdom was to be twisted to darker paths.

Although it had doubtless spent years fermenting, Isengard's treason was first unveiled when Saruman attempted to imprison Gandalf the Grey atop the Tower of Orthanc. It was a cruel act, to betray a friend and mock the just principles of the White Council, but in truth it was merely the first, and perhaps least, in a long list of calumnies the White Wizard would perpetrate. Under orders from the Dark Lord's agents, Saruman turned his vast intellect towards the forging of a new and deadly force within the bounds of Isengard, an army worthy of Mordor.

Around Orthanc the monstrous fires of industry blazed hot as weapons and armour were forged in vast quantities and, in dark pits cut deep into the ground, horrendous experiments were conducted by the White Wizard. Saruman's goal was to create a new breed of warrior, crossing Orcs with Goblin-men. These Fighting Uruk-hai, as they would become known, would eventually prove to be one of the most formidable armies in the War of The Ring, for each Uruk was at least the height of a man and possessed an unnatural strength that meant they could run without wearying and fight with crushing power. Clad in crude but sturdy armour plates, the Uruk-hai were as resilient as any, save perhaps the distant armies of the Dwarves, and their fanatical devotion was equal to that of Men.

Before his vast legions were ready to march on Rohan in open war, Saruman wasted no time unleashing droves of scouts to search for the Ringbearer and to lay waste to Rohan's Westfold. Ravenous packs of Warg Riders swept across the rolling plains, wreaking devastation where they rode, while bands of scouting Uruk-hai, goaded on by bloodthirsty Captains, gave chase to The Fellowship of the Ring along the banks of the Anduin. Of course, the full horror of his master plan was unleashed as thousands of Uruk-hai swept across the Fords of Isen and arrived to besiege Helm's Deep in what would be one of the bloodiest and most decisive battles of the War of The Ring. There, beneath darkened skies and driving rain, the Fighting Uruk-hai would unleash their full fury and test their mettle in an effort to wipe the Kingdom of Rohan from the face of Middle-earth.

### HEROES OF ISENGARD

#### SARUMAN 180 POINTS
**WIZARD, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF LEGEND**

Once the leader of the Councils of the Wise, and the eponymous head of
the White Council, Saruman the White allowed himself to be corrupted by the persuasive powers of the Dark Lord as he gazed
jealously into the Palantir of Orthanc. In so doing he embarked on a road that would see him stripped of his nobility and twisted into a
treacherous parody of a true Istari. So aligned, he turned his
prodigious intellect to building an army to rival the Dark Lord's own. What
Saruman hoped to ultimately gain from his betrayal is shrouded in mystery, but he nonetheless used his magical knowledge against his
former friend Gandalf the Grey and, in a stroke, sentenced thousands to die by fire and sword as his legions invaded Rohan.

**SPECIAL RULES**
- The Palantir - Although ultimately it enabled the Dark Lord to bind Saruman to his will, the Palantir of Orthanc also granted the White Wizard the ability to scry across great distances and discern things hitherto unknown to him.

Once per game the controlling player can use the Palantir to automatically win a Priority roll - the use of this special rule must be declared before any dice are rolled for Priority.

- Voice of Curunir - It's said that Saruman's greatest power is his voice.

Saruman's Stand Fast! has a range of 12" and, unlike other Hero models' Stand Fast! rolls, can affect other Hero models.

- Lord of the Istari - Before his treachery, Saruman was the most powerful of the five Wizards sent to Middle-earth. His treason did nothing to lessen his power.

Saruman the White can choose to re-roll one dice when making Casting or Resist tests.

#### GRIMA WORMTONGUE 25 POINTS
**MAN, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - INDEPENDENT HERO**

Grima is a man of Rohan who willingly sold his services to Saruman in
exchange for promises of wealth and power, a despicable act that saw him inveigle his way into the services of King Theoden where he
could cause the most harm. When Rohan's need for heroic leadership was greatest, the counsel of Grima was words of despair. So it was that
a lord of great promise was stripped of his will to act, sitting indolent and oblivious as the Westfold burned. Though he is no warrior,
Grima's strength lies in his ability to twist the words and thoughts of those around him, robbing even the wise of their heroism.

**Mv F S D A W C**

**WARGEAR**
- Dagger

**OPTIONS**
- Horse 10 points

**SPECIAL RULES**
- A Traitor Within - Grima may be deployed in one of two ways, either as part of the Isengard force or as part of an enemy's warband.

Grima must be deployed in Saruman's warband if deployed as part of the Isengard force.

Alternatively, before deployment begins, you may attach Grima to an enemy warband. When this warband is deployed or moves onto the battlefield, you must immediately place Grima afterwards as if he was a member of that warband. Grima is always controlled by his controlling player and moves and fights when it is his controlling player's turn to do so as usual.

If deployed as part of the enemy's army (but not as part of his own army), no enemy model can shoot at or strike blows against Grima. Nor can they shoot if Grima is In The Way of the shot. Enemy models are allowed to Charge Grima and fight, but strike no blows if they win. Note that Grima can be targeted by Magical Powers - after all, it is Gandalf who roots out his wicked ways!

This restriction ends if Saruman is slain, if Grima voluntarily Charges an enemy model or if Grima scores a Wound with his dagger (even if the Wound is avoided with Fate). Grima can decide not to strike blows if he wins a Duel roll in order not to reveal his real allegiance. Once one of these conditions is met, the depth of Grima's evil is revealed and he becomes an enemy who can be shot at and fought in the same way as any other enemy model.

- Wormtongue - If an enemy Hero model is within 6" of Grima, 2 Might points must be expended to use Heroic Actions instead of 1.

#### LURTZ 90 POINTS
**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF VALOUR**

The mightiest of Saruman's Uruk-hai, Lurtz is entrusted with leading the mission to capture the Ringbearer. At the head of a contingent of Scouting Uruk-hai, this relentless Orc is dogged in his pursuit, tracking The Fellowship of the Ring to Amon Hen, and there dispatching Boromir with merciless efficiency.

#### UGLUK 65 POINTS
**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF FORTITUDE**

A captain in Lurtz's raiding force, Ugluk takes command of the Uruk-hai Scouts after the ambush at Amon Hen, driving his warriors (and their Hobbit prisoners) onwards towards Isengard. Unflinching obedience to Saruman's orders is all that drives Ugluk onwards, and when Grishndkh's Orcs threaten his prisoners, Ugluk is swift to act, restoring order and loyalty within the ranks with a single sweep of his blade.

Furthermore, in a turn that Ugluk does this, he will automatically pass his Courage test and his Stand Fast! has a range of 12" and affects both Warrior and Hero models.

#### SHARKU 50 POINTS
**ORC, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF FORTITUDE**

The sly Orc known as Sharku was tasked by the White Wizard of Isengard with ranging deep into Rohan to sow panic and destruction. Such a mission suited this cruel Orc well, for Sharku delighted in riding down the weak and afraid, and allowing his Warg to feast on the fallen. Not that he was unwilling to fight armed warriors though. Indeed, Sharku's warband very nearly cost the realms of both Rohan and Gondor their kings.

#### VRASKU 65 POINTS
**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF FORTITUDE**

Among the captains that lead the Uruk-hai Scouts, Vrasku is the best shot. Equipped with a modified crossbow in recognition of his prodigious skill, he can loose the powerful bolts with a speed and precision unlike any other Orc. Perhaps Vrasku's most distinguishing trait is his utter ruthlessness. He will shoot at his target, regardless of other Uruks in the way, and such is his prowess, with both blade and crossbow, that none dare gainsay him.

**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF FORTITUDE**

Ahead of the bands of scouting Uruk-hai range Mauhur's Marauders, the swiftest and most eager of Isengard's scouting Uruk-hai. Mauhur is the leader of these warriors, and his reputation has been built upon his speed and his berserk frenzy in combat. With two scuffed and battered swords he unleashes an avalanche of hacking, slashing blows. No sooner has his first foe fallen, then he sets off after another, his baying war cry carrying ahead of him on the wind.

#### THRYDAN WOLFSBANE 85 POINTS
**MAN, DUNLENDING, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF FORTITUDE**

Thrydan Wolfsbane is the war chief of Dunland, a royal-blooded outcast of a people driven from their homeland in ancient times. For generations, the Dunlendings have watched the hated Forgoil with seething resentment, determined to one day banish them from their lands. The alliance of Dunland with Isengard at last gives Thrydan and his people the opportunity they have longed for - for when the Legions of the White Hand have crushed the Rohirrim, the Dunlendings will at last inherit their birthright.

#### URUK-HAI CAPTAIN 60 POINTS
**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF FORTITUDE**

Command of Isengard's legions falls to the many Uruk-hai Captains. Stoic and hardy, these unsubtle orcish brutes can be relied upon to carry out Saruman's orders with exactness, leading the warriors around them with single-minded determination. In battle, they are a brutal horror, their strength and toughness great enough to make any foe baulk.

At the head of the Isengard scouts run the formidable Scout Captains. Under the command of the White Wizard, these relentless creatures tirelessly track down their prey, stopping at nothing until they have slain or captured their target. Uruk-hai Scout Captains have led their followers in tracking The Fellowship at Amon Hen, and commanded the raids upon the settlements of Rohan under the instruction of Saruman.

**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, HERO - MINOR HERO**

The Uruk-hai bred in the pits beneath Orthanc have been raised with a fanatical devotion to the White Wizard and, some whisper, a hint of dark magic. Within their ranks are a few whose harshly-barked incantations are able to drive their fellows to feats of insane bravery and resilience, or unman their foe with nought but a transfixing glare.

As the Uruk-hai march relentlessly into battle, they do so to the low thudding of the drums that accompany them. Uruk-hai Drummers are tasked with the important job of ensuring that the Uruks' pace does not falter, keeping them moving at the rapid speed that their master requires of them.

Fierce, violent lifestyles are the norm in Dunland, a forsaken land where chieftains rule over squalid settlements with an iron grip. These warlords are powerful fighters who guard their authority with strength and savagery. Many is the Rohirrim who have fallen beneath the notched axes of these tribal overlords, undone as much by strength and force of will than any skill or cunning.

#### URUK-HAI SCOUT 8 POINTS
**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, WARRIOR**
Unleashed from the pits of Orthanc with a single mission, the Uruk-hai Scouts loyal to the White Hand were tasked with dragging the Ringbearer to the White Wizard. Stronger than Orcs and better able to resist the glare of the sun, these warriors were able to run for days on end and still fight with animalistic ferocity. Before long, raiding parties of Scouts also roved far into Rohan, laying waste to settlements and driving the Rohirrim from their homes.

Orcs were not the only creatures to be subjected to Saruman's dark experiments in the pits below Isengard. Trolls too were included in the machinations of the White Wizard.

#### URUK-HAI BERSERKER 15 POINTS
**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, WARRIOR**
The most barbarous and brutal of the Uruk-hai are the Berserkers, frenzied killers who are hurled into battle to break through enemy lines and secure a foothold during sieges. Before they are unleashed, their helmets are filled with blood and then thrust roughly onto their head. This hideous ritual drives the Berserkers into a murderous state in which they will ignore peril and wound alike in their haste to hack the enemy apart.

**Mv F S D A W C**
6* 4/4+ 4 5 2 1 7

**WARGEAR**
- Berserker blade.

**Berserker Blade** - Saruman's grand plan for his Berserkers was to have them scale ladders and hack the walls of the Hornburg clear at the siege
of Helm's Deep with crazed sweeps of their enormous swords.

A Berserker blade is a hand-and-a-half sword. If an Uruk-hai Berserker
wins a Duel roll while fighting with its Berserker blade as a two-handed
weapon, it may either assign strikes as normal, or do one Strength 4 hit at +1
To Wound on every model Engaged in the fight or supporting the Berserker and in base contact (friend and foe).

**SPECIAL RULES**
- Oblivious to Pain - Relentlessly cleaving through their enemy's
defences, Uruk-hai Berserkers are unphased by the pain inflicted on them both in
the fight or by arrows fired into their flesh.

Every time an Uruk-hai Berserker suffers a Wound, roll a D6. On the
roll of a 6, the wound is ignored exactly as if a point of Fate had been spent.
This is not cumulative with other special rules that confer the same effect.

- Impervious to Bow-fire - The tough skin and frenzied
minds of these Uruks allows them to shrug off injuries from the hail of arrows that rain down
upon them.

Uruk-hai Berserkers count their Defence characteristic as 6 when an
enemy model makes a shooting attack against them.

#### FERAL URUK-HAI 13 POINTS
**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, WARRIOR**
Driven to the brink of madness by torture and cruelty, the Feral Uruk-hai are a savage weapon intended to be unleashed where they can wreak the bloodiest havoc. In battle they fight with wanton savagery, crashing into shieldwalls with murderous glee and chasing after fleeing foes without the merest hint of mercy.

**Mv F S D A W C**

Every time a Feral Uruk-hai suffers a Wound, roll a D6. On a 6, the

Wound is ignored exactly as if a point of Fate had been spent. This is
not cumulative with other special rules that confer the same effect.

#### DUNLENDING WARRIOR
**MAN, DUNLENDING, INFANTRY, WARRIOR**
For generations, the people of Dunland have loathed the Rohirrim, blaming the Horse Lords for exiling them from their ancestral homelands. When Saruman offered this fiercely tribal people the chance for revenge, they readily sided with the legions of the White Hand, mustering in great numbers to join the battle against their oppressors.

The Wild Men are outcasts, even among their own people. They live in the most isolated and bleak areas of Dunland in scrofulous settlements where they bitterly lament the lands they have lost. When Saruman's call to war is answered by Dunland, these dishevelled hillsmen flocked to the ranks with vicious enthusiasm.

#### URUK-HAI DEMOLITION TEAM 80 POINTS
**URUK-HAI, ISENGARD, INFANTRY, WARRIOR**
It is not enough for Saruman that he has unleashed an army of thousands
against Helm's Deep - his plan is to destroy Rohan's greatest defence utterly. To that end, he has fabricated explosive charges which
can be detonated with devastating effect. A whispered treachery from Grima Wormtongue informing the White Wizard exactly where these
bombs will be most effective.

**COMPOSITION**
- An Uruk-hai Demolition team has two Uruk-hai Warriors with swords, one Uruk-hai Berserker with a flaming brand and Berserker blade and one demolition charge (see below),

**OPTIONS**
- Equip Uruk-hai Warrior with flaming brand 1 point

**DEMOLITION CHARGES**
- The devilry of Saruman has created weapons of monstrous power. Any caught nearby when these demolition charges are ignited are likely to be blown to smithereens.

**Moving the Charge** - A demolition charge is a Heavy Object, as on page 110 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Rules Manual. It may never be carried by mounted models.

**Detonating the Charge** - To use the demolition charge it must be dropped. A model with a flaming brand in base contact with the charge, which is not also Engaged in combat, may attempt to set it off at the start of the Fight phase. The model attempting to set off the charge must pass a Courage test. If it fails, it cannot detonate the charge. If it succeeds, the Evil player rolls on the Detonation table to determine the effects.

When it explodes, a demolition charge automatically strikes everything within 2" of the model - gates, doors, and of course, any models (friend or foe) that are in range of it. Each target struck automatically takes D6 Wounds, regardless of its Defence value. Cavalry models take D6 hits on both the mount and the rider.

**Desperate Detonations** - Without a burning brand, causing a detonation is hard. Any model from the same army as the demolition charge may attempt a Desperate Detonation at the start of the Fight phase as long as it is in base contact and not Engaged in combat. It must also pass a Courage test as normal. For each model attempting this, roll a D6. If one or more 6s are rolled, the charge is detonated - roll on the Detonation table as usual.

**Flaming Brands** - Touching a flaming torch to one of Saruman's bombs takes a courage beyond sanity.

A model carrying a flaming brand cannot use a two-handed weapon (if it has one). If a model carrying a flaming brand is killed, the brand is extinguished and lost in the chaos of battle.

**Attacking the Charge** - The demolition charge can be shot at normally, and has a Defence of 7 and 3 Wounds. If the charge is wounded, roll a D6 per Wound inflicted. On a 6, the charge immediately detonates - roll on the Detonation table as normal.

A demolition charge that is wounded by another demolition charge will be detonated on the roll of a 4+ (per Wound suffered) rather than a 6.

If brought to 0 Wounds without exploding, the demolition charge is shattered and the powder scatters harmlessly on the ground - remove the charge from play.

An enemy model that spends a Fight phase in base contact with a demolition charge, and is not Engaged in combat, may automatically disable it. Remove it from play.

**DETONATION TABLE**

*D6 RESULT*

1. *Dud. The charge has been damaged in some way and will not detonate; remove it from play.*
 *2‑5 Instant Reaction. The charge catches instantly, exploding in a roar of smoke and flame, as described previously.*

6. *Titanic Explosion. The powder in the charge detonates with colossal fury as described previously, but inflicts 2D6 Wounds rather than D6.*

#### ISENGARD ASSAULT BALLISTA
**SIEGE ENGINE**
65 POINTS

The Uruk-hai army that besieged Helm's Deep was no mere rabble, but a well-ordered host with weapons and wargear devised by the White Wizard himself. Assault Ballistae were wheeled into position to fire massive bolts, easily twice the length of a man, over the battlements, behind which were dragged heavy ropes that enabled siege ladders to be effortlessly raised. Of course, a weapon of such power is equally useful if aimed at the enemy, where the bolt can cut through ranks of warriors or fell an Ent with a single hit.

**Siege Engine Strength Defence Wounds**
Ballista (9) 10 4

**CREW**
- An Isengard Assault Ballista is a large Siege Engine and is crewed by three Uruk-hai warrior crew wearing heavy armour. One is armed with a sword, one a dagger and the other carries an Assault Ballista bolt (pike). Any additional crew purchased will be equipped with heavy armour and a sword. One of the crew is automatically the Siege Veteran. All crew members have the Uruk-hai, Isengard, Infantry and Warrior keywords.

**Mv F S D A W C**
6" 4/4+ 4 5 1 1 3

**OPTIONS**
- Uruk-hai Engineer Captain 50 points
- Additional Crew 9 points each
- Superior Construction 15 points

**SPECIAL RULES**
- Piercing Shot - If a shot from an Isengard Assault Ballista hits a Battlefield target, then they will suffer one single Strength 9 hit. Additionally, if the target has Strength 5 or lower, they will be knocked Prone and flung D6" directly away from the Ballista. Any model that the target passes over will also be knocked Prone and suffer one single Strength 6 hit. If the target comes into contact with a piece of impassable terrain, or a model that is Strength 6 or higher, then it will immediately stop and be knocked Prone, and both the target and the Obstacle or model (if it has a Defence value) will suffer one Strength 6 hit.

- Raise the Ladders! Part weapon, part siege device, a carefully placed shot from the Assault Ballista can raise a siege ladder in an instant, and propel an Uruk-hai straight into combat.

The Assault Ballista can attempt to raise a ladder to the enemy battlements in the Shoot phase. To do this, the controlling player must first nominate a point on the battlements within range and which at least one crew member and the machine have Line of Sight to. Roll To Hit as usual - if a hit is scored, the grapple has struck home; if the machine misses, there is no further effect. When the grappling hook hits, a single siege ladder within 6" of the wall base below the target point is moved forwards to the wall and raised immediately. All ladder carriers drop their ladder as it is raised. Any one of the carriers can grab the top of the ladder and ride it to the top as it ascends. This model is then placed as if they had climbed to the top of the ladder that turn - which means that they count as charging into combat against a defender at the top of the tower if there is one. Furthermore, the defender will receive no benefit from defending an obstacle in the turn that a ladder is raised in this way..

- Accurate - An Isengard Assault Ballista will only scatter 3" rather than 6".
