[]{#bookmark832 .anchor}**AZOG'S LEGION**

*Marching upon the kingdoms of Erebor and Dale, Azog's legions spill forth from the cesspits of Dol Guldur eager for the sound of battle and the taste of blood. As the bitter rivalry between the feuding Elves and Dwarves comes to a head, Azog unleashes his legions upon his unsuspecting enemies, the giant were- wyrms that lay beneath the plains of Erebor providing passage for Azog's vast legions of Orcs and other foul creatures.*

*From atop his signal tower, Azog can observe the ever-changing ebb and flow of the battle that rages on beneath him, allowing him to use his tactical mind to react to the battle as it changes. Using his signal tower, Azog commands his forces with a combination of banners and horns, alerting his troops to a change in tactics or to execute a specific manoeuvre.*

*The bulk of Azog's armies are made up of the vicious Orcs from Dol Guldur and Gundabad. Clad in thick, crude armour, these Orcs are veterans of the many wars with the Dwarves and Elves, the hatred of
their races still etched into their brains. Desperate to spill the blood of
their most bitter enemies, these Orcs are unleashed upon the ranks of Dwarves, Men and Elves, intent on destroying every single one of them.*

*It is not just Orcs that Azog commands â€” he also has a host of fearsome warbeasts at his disposal. Huge Trolls march forth from Gundabad, armed with crude wooden clubs or sharpened gauntlets used to cleave through enemy ranks with frightening ease. Some Trolls are so large, they can be fitted with a whole catapult upon their back. It is these that Azog uses to smash through the walls of Dale, allowing his warriors to flood the city. Although not as big as Trolls, Ogres
are an imposing threat, smashing aside Dwarves and Men in order to bring death to Azog's enemies.*

*From the north, a second army approaches. Bolg has ridden to Mount Gundabad in order to bring forth the vast legions that lie within the fortress' iron walls. Alongside the numerous Gundabad Orc Warriors run the Gundabad Berserkers, hulking Orcs wielding brutal and wicked-looking weapons. War Bats flock from the caves of the mountains. These dread creatures have been bred specifically for war and their razor-sharp talons will see to the deaths of Dwarves and Elves alike.*

*It is these forces that Azog believes will secure a bloody and decisive
victory, allowing for the kingdom of Angmar to rise again and bring terror back to the north, as well as letting the Pale Orc finally settle an old
score and erase the line of Durin for good.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Azog; Bolg; Gundabad Orc Captains;

Goblin Mercenary Captains; Gundabad Orc Warriors;

Gundabad Berserkers; Gundabad Trolls; Catapult Trolls; Troll Brutes; Ogres; War Bats and Goblin Mercenaries.

**ARMY BONUS**

"Let the legions come forth!" â€” If either Azog or Bolg is the leader of your force then they gain the Master of Battle special rule.

resistance to his power in the north. The time for secrecy has passed, and the Pale
Orc is now unleashed upon his foes as the fearsome general of Sauron's
massed hordes, intent on finishing what he started and ending the line of
Durin.*

Stone Flail â€” *This huge stone flail is capable of crushing bone and flinging enemies to the ground.*

The stone flail is a two-handed weapon that follows the normal rules for flails, with the following exceptions. When fighting with the stone flail, Azog's Fight value is reduced to 6/5+. Azog does not reduce his Fight value for using the Whirl Special Strike. Additionally, Wounds inflicted by the stone flail cause not 1 Wound but D3 Wounds instead (determine the number of Wounds after Fate points are used), and any model that is struck, but not slain, is knocked Prone.

**SPECIAL RULES**

General of the North â€” *By Sauron's will, Azog is the undisputed commander of the Orc hordes.*

Azog's Stand Fast! rule has a range of 12" and, unlike any other Hero model's Stand Fast! rule, can affect other Orc Hero models.

I am the Master â€” *Azog is a jealous leader, and will fight any who threaten his rule.*
 When rolling To Wound an enemy Hero model after winning a Fight, Azog never needs to roll more than a 3+ to score a wound, regardless of their Defence.

**SIGNAL TOWER**

*Azog commands his legions of Orcs from atop his Signal Tower. Using the
huge banners that make it up, Azog is able to direct his troops from a
great distance â€” the giant horn ringing out to signal a change in the Pale
Orc's plans. Upon this purpose-built command position, Azog has complete
control over the battles that rage below.*

The Signal Tower consists of four major parts:

-   The Banner of Dol Guldur â€” The largest and most imposing     banner upon the tower.

-   The Banner of Gundabad â€” The two-pronged banner located to     the right of the tower.

-   The Banner of Angmar â€” The central stationary banner.

-   The Horn of Gorgoroth â€” The giant horn.

The Signal Tower also comes with seven of Azog's Lieutenants, armed with swords, to man the tower. These Lieutenants do not count as part of Azog's warband and may not lead troops.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Ancient Enemies (Dwarf), Ancient Enemies (Elf).

Signal Tower â€” The Tower is placed in position before a battle commences, allowing for Azog to command his troops effectively from the start of the battle.

Before deployment, but after players have decided on their board edges, the controlling player may place the Signal Tower, plus the seven of Azog's Lieutenants, anywhere on the battlefield.

The Signal Tower may not be subsequently moved. Note: the

It must always be Manned â€” *The different parts of the Signal Tower must all be manned in order for them to function and
deliver Azog's commands.*

Any of Azog's Lieutenants may man a part of the Signal Tower â€” to do this they must be in base contact with the part they wish to man. Whilst manned, each part of the Signal Tower has a different effect, as follows:

-   The Banner of Dol Guldur USEI â€” All friendly Gundabad     models on the battlefield count themselves as being in range of     a banner.

-   The Banner of Gundabad â€” All friendly Gundabad     Hero models on the battlefield may declare Heroic Marches     without reducing their store of Might.

-   The Banner of Angmar â€” Whenever a friendly     Gundabad model on the battlefield suffers a Wound, roll a     D6. On the roll of a natural 6, the Wound is ignored exactly     as if a point of Fate had been spent. Note that this supersedes     other rules that confer similar effects, e.g., Fury.

-   The Horn of Gorgoroth â€” Counts as a War Horn.     Additionally, all enemy models on the battlefield suffer -1 to     their Courage value. Note that this is not cumulative with     other rules that confer similar penalties.

Summoning of the Hosts â€” *Atop his signal tower, Azog is able to command masses of Orcs at once.*

If the Signal Tower is taken as an upgrade for Azog, then 24 Warriors may be included in Azog's warband rather than 18. These may deploy within 12" of Azog rather than the usual 6".

Destroying the Signal Tower â€” Each part of the Tower has a Defence value of 10 with 3 Wounds, and each is considered as a separate Battlefield target. Additionally, if an enemy model spends a full turn in base contact with any part of the Signal Tower without doing anything else (i.e., not shooting, using Magical Powers or fighting in combat), then that part of the Signal Tower is disabled and its effect is lost.

As long as Azog is mounted upon the White Warg, you can expend either Azog's or the White Warg's stores of Might, Will and Fate as if they shared the same profile (though you should still mark down which of the two actually expended each point).

Pack Master â€” *The White Warg is a feral beast.*

Once separated from Azog, only Warg models may use the White Warg's Stand Fast! rule or benefit from its Heroic Actions.

Raging Beast â€” *The clamour of battle drives the White Warg into a relentless rage.*

When Azog dismounts, the White Warg automatically passes its Courage test to stay and fight. Additionally, it will automatically pass all Courage tests for the rest of the battle.

*From turn 2 onwards, the controlling player must test to see if their
Goblin Mercenaries have arrived. To do this, the Goblin Mercenary Captain must make a Courage test at any point during the controlling player's Move
phase.*

*If the test is passed, the controlling player may choose whether or not
the Goblin Mercenaries have arrived. If the test is failed, then the opposing
player may choose whether or not the Goblin Mercenaries have arrived.*

*Once they have arrived, the controlling player places the warband fully
within any eligible terrain piece on the board. Models deployed in this way may
not be placed within the Control Zones of any enemy models. This counts as
the Goblin Mercenaries' movement for that turn. If the entire warband cannot
be placed for any reason (such as there are no eligible terrain pieces),
then they may arrive as Reinforcements from a board edge of the controlling
player's choice instead.*

Wounds caused before Fate points are used. Any model that is targeted with

at his disposal. Great war catapults are strapped to these hulking
creatures, creating the ultimate siege weapons, which are capable of bringing Dale's walls

Trolls are also able to crush their foes in battle.*

**WARGEAR**

Catapult and metal gauntlets.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Terror.

Catapult â€” A Catapult Troll always follows the rules for Volley Fire, giving it a range of 12"-96". Shots fired from the Catapult are resolved at Strength 10. When firing the Catapult, follow the rules for Siege Engines in the main rules manual with the following exceptions:

The Catapult Troll may still fire in the same turn that it has moved in, even if this is up to its full Move value. However, if the Catapult Troll has moved, it will only hit on the roll of a 6. The Catapult may still be fired whilst the Troll is in combat. If you wish to do
this, and a 1 is rolled when rolling To Hit, the Catapult will malfunction and the Catapult Troll will suffer a wound. A Catapult Troll does not have a crew in the same way as a conventional Siege Engine â€” however, it is classed as a large Siege Engine and the Troll itself is considered to be the Siege Veteran. However, unlike other Siege Veterans, the Troll has no points of Might, Will or Fate. Unlike other Siege Engines, the Catapult Troll cannot be destroyed if a model spends its entire turn in base contact with it.

Area Effect â€” *The impact caused by the rocks crashing into the ground is enough to fling nearby warriors to the floor, showering them in
debris.*

If the Catapult scores a hit against a Battlefield target, all Man- sized (or smaller) models within 2" are Knocked to the Ground. Cavalry models within 2" must take a Thrown Rider test. Additionally, any model within 2" also suffers a Strength 6 hit.

Goblin Crew â€” *The Catapults are manned by a team of Goblins who, when needed, will readily join in slaughtering those
unlucky enough to stand against them.*

If the Catapult Troll wins the Fight, in addition to any Strikes that the Troll makes, the Goblin crew may also make Strikes against those in combat with the Troll. The Goblins inflict D6 Strength 3 Strikes if the Catapult Troll wins the Fight. Note that if the Catapult Troll uses a Brutal Power Attack, then the Goblins do not get these additional Strikes.

Metal Gauntlets â€” *The gauntlets attached to these Trolls provide them with sufficient means to swiftly despatch those in their
path. A hit from these weapons can send even the sturdiest of warriors
flying.*

Catapult Trolls never count as being unarmed. Furthermore, count their Strength as 10 when rolling for distance with a Hurl Brutal Power Attack.

*Tortured and mutilated by Orcs, these Trolls have been specifically bred for war. Many of them have had limbs removed and replaced with crude and merciless weaponry. With every lumbering stride, they crush and mangle those in their path, spiked feet and swinging flails leaving a trail of broken bodies and splattered gore in their wake.*

*Smaller, but less cumbersome than the Trolls of Azog's legions, the Ogres pose a different threat at the Battle of the Five Armies. Wielding huge wooden clubs, these foul creatures are often commanded to seek out war machines and tear them to pieces.*

must inflict a single Strength 10 hit upon that model. Cavalry models suffer
these hits on both the rider and the mount. If the model is slain, then the
Troll Brute may continue its move. If it is not slain, then the Troll Brute stops
(exactly like a charging model would) and, if the model is an enemy, will fight it as

through suffers a Strength 3 hit. A model that they end their move on
is automatically removed as a casualty. A model with this special rule

talons pluck warriors from the field of battle, piercing armour and
tearing flesh as they fling their prey to the ground.*
 Piercing Talons â€” *War Bats are armed with vicious talons that are able to rip through armour with frightening ease.*
When a War Bat Charges, the Defence of the charged model, and any models that subsequently counter-charge, is reduced by 2 against the War Bat's Strikes.
Pluck â€” *As a War Bat flies over its prey, it will attempt to seize it in its vicious talons and fling it to the ground.*

At the end of a War Bat's Move, pick an unengaged Man-sized (or smaller) enemy model that it has moved over and roll a D6. On a 4+, that model suffers a Strength 4 hit. If it survives, roll another dice. On a 4+, that model is Knocked to the Ground.

[]{#bookmark944 .anchor}**AZOG'S HUNTERS**

*Ever since his defeat at the Battle of Azanulbizar, over a hundred years before, Azog has thirsted for the blood of Thorin Oakenshield. His desire to exact a brutal and bloody revenge upon the heir of Erebor has all but consumed him, driving him to near madness. From his camp atop the ruined watchtower of Amon SÃ»l, Azog has sent out word of a price upon the head of Thorin and has gathered to him all manner of barbaric creatures to aid him in his crusade to wipe out the line of Durin.*

*The Pale Orc rides into battle upon his great White Warg, a huge and vicious beast that towers over Orc and Warg alike. Atop this beast,
Azog leads his followers in the hunt for Thorin's Company. Alongside the
Pale Orc rides his spawn, Bolg. Every bit as cruel and unrelenting as his father, it is Bolg who continues the chase for the Dwarves when Azog is summoned by the dark power that dwells in Dol Guldur â€” the true master of evil.*

*Azog's Hunters are made up of many packs of vile Hunter Orcs, cunning and silent killers that have become accustomed to tracking their
targets*

*across all manner of terrain. Alongside them ride the Fell Wargs,
beasts of an untapped power. Their senses greater than those of their lesser kin,
Fell Wargs make for a deadly addition to Azog's forces. There are even some Orcs brave, or foolish, enough to ride these vicious creatures,
combining the skills of both warriors to create a threat that is much greater than
the sum of its parts.*

*In the absence of either Azog or Bolg, the Hunter Orcs are led by
their captains, ruthless veterans who are tasked with keeping their packs in line and doing the will of the Pale Orc. Many of these captains have found that their skills lend them to different roles within the ranks of the Hunter Orcs. Fimbul has proven himself to be an expert in tracking and riding atop a Fell Warg, and so it is he that leads the Warg Riders into war. Narzug has exceptional skill with a bow, even for an Orc without the training of an Elf or Man. Even Yazneg, despite all of his failures, has proven his worth at times, leading the initial pursuit of the Dwarves. It is quite possible that, without the intervention of the Elves of Rivendell, Yazneg would have returned to Azog with the head of Thorin in his hands and the quest of the company would have failed.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Azog; Bolg; Yazneg; Narzug; Fimbul the Hunter; Hunter Orc Captains; Hunter Orcs and Fell Wargs.

The profile for Azog can be found on page 93. Azog counts as a Hero of Legend if taken as part of an Azog's Hunters army list. Azog may not take the Signal Tower, heavy armour or stone flail if taken as part of an Azog's Hunters army list.

**ARMY BONUS**

"They strike in the wee small hours when everyone's asleep" â€” The Azog's Hunters army list may include 50% bows rather than 33%. Additionally, all models in the Azog's Hunters army list have their Shoot value improved by 1.

The Price of Failure â€” *Yazneg's master is not one to tolerate failure
lightly...*
 If your army contains both Azog and Yazneg, and the two are in base contact at the beginning of your Move phase, instead of rolling the dice to make a Courage test when your force is Broken, you can remove Yazneg from play. If you do so, Azog is considered to have automatically passed his Courage test and his Stand Fast! will affect the entire battlefield. Furthermore, if Yazneg is removed from play in this way then whilst Azog is still alive, all Hunter Orcs, Hunter Orc Captains, Fimbul the Hunter and Narzug re-roll failed Courage tests.

*One of the captains of Azog's Hunter Orcs, Narzug possesses an unusually exceptional skill with a bow for an Orc, even rivaling that of some Men. His arrows are laced with a deadly toxin, and those who are pierced by one of Narzug's arrows will soon be left choking on the poison that rushes through their veins, if the initial shot didn't do the job. Like all of those that lead packs of Hunter Orcs, Narzug is a vicious fighter and well-versed in both the art of stealth and brutal hand-to-hand combat.*

Morgul Arrows â€” see page 96.
 Lethal Aim â€” *Narzug's skill with a bow is unrivalled within the ranks of the Hunter Orcs.*
Each turn, Narzug may spend a single point of Might without reducing his store (even if he has none remaining) to modify either a To Hit roll, an In The Way roll or a To Wound roll when shooting his Orc bow.

*Fimbul is the wily lieutenant of Azog's Hunters. A cunning Orc who has become accustomed to pursuing and tracking his prey, Fimbul has proven his worth to Azog's cause many times over the years. A vicious fighter, he takes great pride in his skills as a tracker and will doggedly pursue his foes without ever tiring from the chase.*

*Warbands of Hunter Orcs are often led by seasoned veterans, warriors who are well-practiced in both stealth and brutal murder. These captains will tirelessly carry out the bidding of the Pale Orc, often engaging in gruelling pursuits across the mountains and plains of Middle-earth as they track their prey.*

*Unlike the Wargs that dwell elsewhere in Middle-earth, the Fell Wargs utilised by Azog's Hunters are even more fearsome. Their senses are heightened and they can seemingly see around corners and other such barriers, making these beasts a deadly enemy to face. Many unsuspecting warriors have found themselves mauled by these vicious and sinister creatures.*

[]{#bookmark977 .anchor}**DARK POWERS OF DOL GULDUR**

*Dol Guldur was once a stronghold of Sauron whilst he was under the guise of the Necromancer, and was abandoned during the Third Age. However, in more recent years, a darkness has begun to spread outwards from the old fortress' crumbling walls. A sickness has descended upon the Greenwood, giving it the name of Mirkwood, and nothing good grows there anymore.*

*Within the ruins of Dol Guldur, the Necromancer has returned, building his strength as he prepares to unleash his power against the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. The Dark Lord only needs to regain the One Ring to once more bring devastation upon Middle-earth, and cast it into shadow. It is from his position in Dol Guldur that Sauron intends to orchestrate his hunt for the Ring.*

*To his side, Sauron has summoned his most deadly servants to aid him in his dark quest, the NazgÃ»l. However, these incarnations of the Black Riders are unlike any that have been seen before or will be seen again. Clad in thick, spiked armour and wielding a variety of deadly and unusual weaponry, these NazgÃ»l are more suited to the ways of*

*combat, rather than the dark sorceries they have been known for in their other forms. Alongside the NazgÃ»l fight the Castellans of Dol Guldur, mindless and tortured spirits mangled by Sauron's malice and bent to his will. It is these forces that will lead the Dark Lord's
hunt for The One Ring.*

*Sauron also hungers for the Rings of Power, hoping to use them in order to track down The One Ring. It is the task of the monstrous Keeper of the Dungeons to locate and retrieve these rings, by whatever means he deems necessary. The Keeper of the Dungeons takes great delight in the maiming and torturing of those that are held in the cells of Dol Guldur, his lust for blood driving him onwards to complete his task.*

*Legions of Orcs have been drawn to the ever-growing darkness of Dol Guldur, preparing for the wars that are yet to come. Packs of feral Hunter Orcs, along with numerous Fell Wargs, litter the stone floors of the ruined fortress and rank upon rank of vicious Gundabad Orcs head up the ruined city's armies. With Sauron's host built, it will not be
long before he unleashes his full power upon Middle-earth.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: The Necromancer of Dol Guldur; NazgÃ»l of Dol Guldur; The Keeper of the Dungeons; Castellans of Dol Guldur; Hunter Orc Captains; Gundabad Orc Captains; Hunter Orcs; Gundabad Orc Warriors;

Fell Wargs and Mirkwood Spiders.

The profile for Hunter Orc Captains can be found on page 106 and the profile for Gundabad Orc Captains can be found on page 96. These count as Heroes of Fortitude if taken as part of a Dark Powers of Dol Guldur army list.

The profile for Hunter Orcs can be found on page 107, the profile for Gundabad Orc Warriors can be found on page 98 and the profile for Fell Wargs can be found on page 107.

**ADDITIONAL RULES**

The Necromancer, and all nine NazgÃ»l of Dol Guldur, may be deployed as one warband if you wish, so long as the warband contains no other models.

**ARMY BONUS**
 "His Spirit has lost none of its potency" â€” Whenever the Necromancer of Dol Guldur attempts to cast a Magical Power, by expending one or more Will points, he automatically adds an extra free Will point to the Casting test.

*Sauron has returned, his eye now fixed upon the Lonely Mountain that
holds the key to reclaiming the realm of Angmar in the north. Building
his power in Dol Guldur in the guise of the Necromancer, Sauron has assembled a
vast army. Even now, Sauron still wields tremendous power and is able to
make Gandalf's staff disintegrate before his eyes. Unable to fully regain his
form, however, Sauron must use his most deadly of servants to combat the
White Council as they attempt to put a stop to his designs upon Middle-earth.*

Any model that suffers a wound from the Necromancer during the Fight phase is automatically slain regardless of the number of Wounds on its profile. A Hero can use Fate to avoid Wounds suffered, but if even a single Wound is not avoided then the Hero is slain and removed as a casualty.

Master of the NazgÃ»l â€” *The Necromancer's powers sustain the NazgÃ»l, making them much more deadly when near their master.*

Any NazgÃ»l of Dol Guldur in the same army as the Necromancer of Dol Guldur gains a bonus of +1 to their rolls for their Unholy Resurrection special rule whilst he is alive and on the board.

Note: The Necromancer is in fact Sauron. This means you cannot have both Sauron and the Necromancer in the same army, as much as you may want to!

in a grim ballet of whirling blades and darting movement. Able to
constantly return to battle once banished, the servants of the Dark Lord
are a deadly foe unlike any the White Council has faced before.*

**WARGEAR**

Each of the NazgÃ»l has different wargear, as described over the following pages.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Harbinger of Evil, Terror.

One of Nine â€” *Nine rings of power were gifted by Sauron to the race of Men.*

There can only be a maximum of nine Ringwraith models, of any combination (including Ringwraiths or any of the named Wraiths), in your force. Additionally, a Hero wearing the Ring is not invisible to these models as he is to others.

The Servants of Evil â€” *Whilst all of the NazgÃ»l are bound to the will of Sauron, each of them is slightly different, and as such
fights in a different way.*

When choosing which NazgÃ»l to field, pick one option from the list that follows. Each NazgÃ»l may only be taken once, unless otherwise stated.

Unholy Resurrection â€” *Through their dark power, the NazgÃ»l of Dol Guldur are able to return to the field of battle
repeatedly if they are defeated.*

If a model with this special rule is slain, place a marker where it was removed from the board. In the next Priority phase, after Priority has been rolled, roll a D6. On a 3+, the model regains 1 Wound and may be placed anywhere within 6" of the marker, so long as it is not placed in base contact with an enemy model. Any Might or Will points that were spent remain spent. Whilst the marker is in play, the NazgÃ»l counts as on the board for the purpose of working out whether your force is Broken or reduced to 25% â€” though they cannot hold objectives and will still count as slain for the purposes of any special rules that would require a model to be slain (such as a Heroic Combat). If the roll is a 1 or a 2, then the NazgÃ»l has been banished â€” remove the marker and the NazgÃ»l from play. Wounds caused by Magical Powers or Elven-made weapons inflict a -1 penalty to the Unholy Resurrection roll. If, when the game ends, a marker is in play and the corresponding NazgÃ»l is not on the board, that NazgÃ»l will count as having been slain for the purposes of victory conditions.

**THE WITCH-KING OF ANGMAR**

**WARGEAR**

Armour and sword.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Angmar Arisen â€” *The greatest of the Nine, the Witch-king is*

*the most deadly of all the NazgÃ»l.*

The Witch-king has 3 Might instead of 2.

**KHAMÃ›L THE EASTERLING**

**WARGEAR**

Armour and two-handed mace.

**SPECIAL RULES**

RhÃ»nish Fury â€” *Originating from a fierce warrior culture,*

*KhamÃ»l is well-versed in the ways of combat.*

KhamÃ»l the Easterling has 3 Attacks instead of 2.

**THE DARK HEADSMAN**

**WARGEAR**

Armour and axe.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Executioner â€” *This NazgÃ»l takes great pleasure in removing the heads of his foes.*

If the Dark Headsman scores a natural 6 when rolling To Wound, then the Strike causes not 1 Wound but D3 Wounds instead (determine the number of Wounds after Fate points are used).

**THE FORSAKEN**

**WARGEAR**

Armour and Trident Spear.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Trident Spear â€” *An unusual, yet deadly weapon, this spear is capable of penetrating steel plate armour as if it were nothing but
cloth.*

The Trident Spear is a spear. Additionally, the Forsaken must re- roll all failed rolls To Wound.

**THE LINGERING SHADOW**

**WARGEAR**

Armour and sword.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Unnatural Speed â€” *Able to dart around his enemies, the Lingering Shadow's speed is unmatched by any of the NazgÃ»l of Dol Guldur.*

After Priority has been rolled, the controlling player may remove the Lingering Shadow from the board and place him anywhere within 3" of where he originally was. Note, the Lingering Shadow may not be placed in base contact with an enemy model. This does not count as moving.

**THE ABYSSAL KNIGHT**

**WARGEAR**

Armour and Elven-made sword.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Spiritual Displacement â€” *These two NazgÃ»l that share the same name are able to effortlessly interchange with each other.*

An army may include up to two Abyssal Knights. In the Priority phase, after Priority has been rolled for, the controlling player can choose to remove one of the Abyssal Knights from the board and immediately place it into base contact with the other, so long as it is not also placed in base contact with an enemy model. This does not count as moving.

**THE SLAYER OF MEN**

**WARGEAR**

Armour and two-handed mace.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Deadly Strength â€” *The NazgÃ»l, known only as the Slayers of Men, wield their maces with frightening skill and strength.*

An army may include up to two Slayers of Men. Additionally, a Slayer of Men never suffers the -1 penalty for wielding a two-handed weapon.

*The Keeper of the Dungeons guards the prisoners brought to the fortress of Dol Guldur. He is a huge and barbaric Orc who relishes in the torturing and disfiguring of his victims.

Torturer â€” *The Keeper of the Dungeons delights in the maiming of those
in his path. The more pain he inflicts, the more blood he thirsts for.*

Every time the Keeper of the Dungeons slays a model, keep a note of it.
Once he has killed one or more models, he may re-roll To Wound rolls of 1. Once
he has killed three or more models, he causes Terror. Once he has killed five
or more models, he re-rolls all failed To Wound rolls.

*The Keeper of the Dungeons has been tasked with retrieving the Elven rings, a task he is determined
to complete.*

The Keeper of the Dungeons gets a bonus of +1 To Wound against any
model that bears one of the three Elven rings: Nenya, Narya or Vilya.

Morgul blade 5 points

Morgul Blade â€” Once per game, this model's controlling player may declare they are using their Morgul blade during the Fight phase before
rolling To Wound. If a model is using a Morgul blade, they must direct all of
their Strikes against a single target. An enemy that suffers a Wound from the Morgul
blade is automatically slain, regardless of the number of Wounds on their
profile. Heroes may use Fate to avoid these Wounds, but if even a single Wound is not
saved, they are slain. If the model using the Morgul blade is mounted, they must use
the rider's Attacks and Strength if using the Morgul blade.

*Bound to the unrelenting will of the Necromancer, the Castellans of Dol Guldur are mindless spirits born out of malice and the Dark Lord's will to dominate. Who or what they were before succumbing to Sauron's power may never be known, yet now they are bound in shadow eternally and will share in his fate. In war, they have a single purpose, to crush Sauron's enemies.*

**SPECIAL RULES**

Terror, Will of Evil.

Automatons â€” *Castellans are beings of war; they have no knowledge of
tactics or leading an army.*

Castellans of Dol Guldur do not grant their Stand Fast! rule to nearby Warrior models.

Castellans of Dol Guldur may use Will points as Fate points if they
wish.

Will of the Necromancer â€” *Bound to the strength of the Necromancer, Castellans can prolong their existence through unnatural means.*

[]{#bookmark1056 .anchor}**DARK DENIZENS OF MIRKWOOD**

*Within the dark forest of Mirkwood, many foul creatures breed and flock to the dark powers rising in the forest's depths. No longer Greenwood the Great, as it once was in days of old, the forest has since been renamed Mirkwood. Concealed in the dense gloom of the forest, many vile and horrid creatures dwell; many having developed a seemingly unquenchable thirst for blood as they constantly stalk the forest's many paths in search of prey.*

*However, no creature in Mirkwood is as terrifying or as deadly as the Spider Queen. This enormous, bloated creature is a spawn of Ungoliant that has since taken up residence within Mirkwood's trees. Quite how
and when she began her dwelling in the forest is unknown, as are the
reasons for her settling there. Her lair lies deep within it, and those that
enter that foul place do not re-emerge; either dragged there as prey or hunted as
they wander Mirkwood's endless paths.*

*As the Spider Queen migrated to Mirkwood, so too did her kin. Spiders of numerous species nest within the trees, hunting the Elves and unwary travellers that stray off the safe paths and into their
webs. Once the Spiders of Mirkwood have set their eyes on a potential victim, it is unlikely that the unfortunate soul will ever see the outside of the forest again.*

*Mirkwood's constant gloom doesn't just house spiders, it is also home to other evil creatures. Swarms of giant bats swirl around the heads of travellers, disorientating them and biting at exposed flesh, and packs
of ravenous Fell Wargs roam the forest in search of a meal, ever eager to
sink their razor-sharp claws into their prey.*

*Over the course of the Third Age, Mirkwood has become a hostile and dangerous place; no longer the place of beauty that it once was.
Travellers that venture into its boughs must be prepared for its dangers, or they
will never make it out alive.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: The Spider Queen; Mirkwood Spiders; Giant Spiders; Bat Swarms and Fell Wargs.

**ARMY BONUS**

Beasts of Mirkwood â€” So long as your army includes the Spider Queen, warbands composed entirely of Warg models do not need a Hero to lead them if they number six or more models; warbands composed entirely of Spider models do not need a Hero to lead them if they number two or more models; and warbands composed of a mixture of models do not need a Hero to lead them if they number ten or more models. Instead, one Warrior within the warband takes on the role of the warband's captain for the purpose of deployment.

![](../media/3_Middle-earth_-_The_Armies_of_The_Hobbit_media/image198.jpeg)

*Within the depths of Mirkwood, hidden in the shadows, dwells a creature of monstrous terror. This spawn of Ungoliant has grown to an enormous size, feeding on the unwary travellers that innocently stray into her domain. The Spider Queen possesses a malicious intelligence, luring her prey into her clutches before catching them in her vile webs. The back of the Spider Queen is constantly crawling with her numerous offspring who, when commanded by their matriarch, will scuttle forwards in order to feed.*

Spider Webs â€” *Mirkwood Spiders can shoot webs to ensnare their prey.*

*Mirkwood is haunted by many sinister and creeping things that have been twisted and mutated by the dark power corrupting the forest. The species of Mirkwood Spiders that nest in the high branches are perhaps chief amongst them; huge, bloated creatures with a dark intellect and a taste for blood. Many a warrior has succumbed to these creatures, trapped by the thick, sticky webbing they shoot to ensnare their prey.*

A Mirkwood Spider can shoot webs at its enemies. They are treated as a throwing weapon with a range of 8". If a Mirkwood Spider hits its
target, do not roll To Wound. Instead, the model suffers the effects of the Paralyse
Magical Power. A Hero model hit by a Spider Web can choose to expend a Fate
point in the same manner as if it had just suffered a Wound in order to dodge the
attack. If successful, the target model is not Paralysed.

A completely different species of spider to the ones that lurk in the high branches of the forest, these spiders are much more vicious and daring than their cousins, and will not hesitate to terrifyingly rear up their front legs at those who stumble across their nests before charging towards them to feast.*

*Mirkwood is not just home to the giant and bloated spiders that stalk it pathways; there are other sinister creatures that dwell within its branches. Among them are the giant bats, which have grown far beyond their normal size after feasting upon the blood of unfortunate passers-by. When these creatures flock together, they blot out what little sunlight filters down to the woodland floor, allowing them to set upon their prey in near- complete darkness. These bats will often follow Wargs or Mirkwood Spiders on a hunt, both utilising each other in order to secure a meal out of those foolish enough to stray from Mirkwood's paths.*

[]{#bookmark1102 .anchor}**GOBLIN-TOWN**

*Deep within the caverns and caves of The Misty Mountains there are a multitude of Goblin kingdoms, many of which delve deep into the rock of Middle-earth. Perhaps the greatest of these kingdoms is that of Goblin-town. Whilst other kingdoms often use long-dead Dwarven cities, Goblin-town is almost entirely built by the Goblins â€” a combination of rickety wooden walkways and structures made from the bones of their prisoners.*

*In charge of this dread kingdom is the Goblin King. A huge and vile creature, covered in boils and pustules, the Goblin King rules over
Goblin- town with a ruthless malice. His size has in the past led to some
debate over whether he is even a Goblin at all or perhaps some other creature. Such debate only ends one way, with those that doubt him placed upon
the Goblin King's many tools of torture. From atop his grisly throne, he
enjoys nothing more than watching his prisoners squeal in agony as their bones bend and snap upon the 'bone breaker'.*

*The Goblins of Goblin-town are disgusting creatures, riddled with countless diseases and each of them sporting a plethora of deformities. In fact, the greater the amount of mutations that a Goblin has, the*

*higher up the ranks he is considered to be â€” this makes the captains of the Goblin hordes a hideous bunch of nightmarish creatures! These troglodyte beings carry a variety of wicked weapons, crafted from whatever materials they can get their boil-ridden hands on, whether
this is scraps of used metal or even the sharpened edges of the broken bones of their victims.*

*It has been known for the Goblin King to form pacts with other evil beings, for a price. It is for this reason that the Goblin Mercenaries exist. More cunning than those that spend their days dwelling in the darkness of Goblin-town, Goblin Mercenaries plan ambushes for their unsuspecting foes, where they pounce upon them with overwhelming numbers.*

*It is not just Goblins that reside within the darkness of the Misty Mountains. Deep within the caverns dwells a creature who remains unseen. In his possession is an item of immense, malicious power, a relic of Mordor with the spirit of a dark force bound to it. The
creature has no concept of this, however, and uses it to remain invisible to the Goblins that he shares the caves with. It is this small trinket that,
when it falls into the possession of Bilbo Baggins, will shape the future of Middle-earth forever.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: The Goblin K ing; Grinnah; The Goblin Scribe; Gollum; Goblin Captains; Goblin Mercenary Captains, Goblin Warriors and Goblin Mercenaries.

The profile for a Goblin Mercenary Captain can be found on page 97. Goblin Mercenary Captains count as a Hero of Fortitude if taken as part of a Goblin-town army list.

followers with an iron fist, the Goblin King does not suffer trespassers
into his kingdom and delights in finding new and convoluted ways to torture and maim
them.*

Relentless Advance â€” *When the Goblin King charges, any Goblins in his way are in serious danger.*

When the Goblin King Charges into combat, he can pass 'through' friendly Goblin models when he moves. Each Goblin he moves through suffers a Strength 3 hit. Any Goblin that he ends his move on is automatically slain. A model with this special rule cannot be Compelled/Commanded over friendly models if it is forced to Charge as a part of that Magical Power.

Blubbery Mass â€” *The Goblin King's vile blubbery flesh absorbs blows with ease.*

Every time the Goblin King is wounded, roll a D6. On a 3+, the Wound is ignored. Magical Powers and Elven-made weapons ignore this ability.

Goblin Projectile â€” *The Goblin King will readily hurl nearby Goblins at his foes if it suits him.*

In the Shoot phase, if there is a friendly Goblin model in base contact with the Goblin K ing, and neither are Engaged in combat, the Goblin King may make a shooting attack with a range of 12" â€” this counts as a throwing weapon. Remove the Goblin, roll To Hit and take any In The Way tests for the shooting attack. The shot is resolved at Strength 8 and will automatically knock Prone any model it hits.

At the end of his Move phase, the Goblin Scribe may opt to take a
Courage test. If the test is passed, you may move D3 extra Goblin Warriors onto
the board (+1 for each point that he passed his test by) â€” from an edge
chosen by the controlling player. If the Goblin Scribe is forced to automatically
pass this Courage test, then D3 Goblin Warriors will enter the board as described
above.

Immobile â€” *Withered and feeble, the Goblin Scribe cannot move on his own.*

The Goblin Scribe is automatically Trapped if he loses a Fight.
Additionally, in the Move phase, friendly models may move him and his frame, in which
case he is considered to be a Heavy Object.

[]{#bookmark1160 .anchor}**THE TROLLS**

*Stone Trolls often dwell in The Misty Mountains;*

*hulking and vicious creatures that relish causing pain to those they encounter. Yet these creatures have one distinct weakness â€” the sun. Should a Stone Troll be caught within the sun's rays, they will quickly find themselves transmogrifying into the very substance that the mountain they herald from is made of.*

*Bill, Bert and Tom are three such creatures. Venturing down from the mountains, further than any Stone Trolls had done in an Age, the Three Trolls set up camp at the aptly named Trollshaws. Quite how long they had spent in their dwellings remains unknown, but they had managed to build up an impressive hoard of treasure, weapons (including Sting, Glamdring and Orcrist) and, of course, gold.*

*The Trolls had raided the surrounding areas for food, feasting upon the local people, livestock and whatever else they could get their
giant grubby hands on.*

*It is these three Trolls that the company of Thorin Oakenshield
encounter as they make their way towards The Misty Mountains. Rushing out to save their burglar from being scoffed by the squabbling Trolls, the Dwarves then find themselves caught and bagged up by these creatures, ready to be cooked and eaten, as well. If it wasn't for Bilbo's quick
and clever thinking, the company would surely have perished; for the
Hobbit's stalling tactics bought enough time for Gandalf to return to the
company's rescue â€” smiting stone and drenching the Trolls in sunlight, and thus sealing their fate.*

his race, Bill is a deadly foe and is more than a match for even the
most skilled warrior. He has a short fuse at the best of times and, in the days
leading to the Trolls' encounter with a certain Hobbit, the constant
meals of roast mutton have made him all the more irritable.*

*In the ages gone by, somewhere within the mountains to the north of Middle-earth, dwelt the great Fire-drakes.*

*These mighty creatures would strike fear into the hearts of any who would hear their roar, and few were those that would ever get the chance to witness one of these incredible creatures and live to tell the tale.*

*However, out of all of the great Fire-drakes of the North, there was one that was more feared and more famous than any other in history â€” Smaug.*

*It was with the destruction of the cities of Dale and Erebor that
Smaug truly became the feared wyrm of legend. For under the rule of ThrÃ³r, the vast treasure hoard of Erebor had continued to grow, its wealth unmatched among the Dwarven kingdoms of Middle-earth. It was this great wealth that drew Smaug to Erebor, for Dragons covet gold more than anything else.*

*The city of Dale was the first to feel Smaug's wrath, the Dragon setting the city alight and razing its buildings to the ground. The citizens of Dale could only flee the city, or die in the attempt. The city's guard did what they could to force Smaug back, but the Dragon's wrath was too fierce and those that stayed to fight him soon felt the full force of his power. Even Girion, the lord of the
city, was unable to slay the beast. Firing Black Arrow after Black Arrow at him, Girion was unable to pierce Smaug's hide and ultimately perished along with his city.*

*It was following Dale's destruction that Smaug turned his attention to Erebor. Smashing through the mountain's stone walls, Smaug laid claim to The Lonely Mountain and the treasure that lay within. Though ThrÃ³r and many of his kin managed to flee the city, and escape the Dragon's
fury, Erebor was ultimately lost. Smaug, the greatest and chiefest calamity,
had become King Under the Mountain.*

left in Middle-earth. His greed led him to covet the great wealth of Erebor for
himself, and so he took wing, caring not that in order to claim his
prize he had to assail the greatest kingdom of Durin's folk. So were Erebor and the
neighbouring Dale, City of Men, laid to ruin, and the survivors forced
to flee their ancestral homes.*

Smaug cannot be Knocked to the Ground or otherwise moved against his will, and never Backs Away if he loses a Fight â€” his opponents must Back Away, even if they win! As a result of this, Smaug can never be Trapped.

Missing Scale â€” *Though Girion, Lord of Dale, failed to slay Smaug, one of his arrows left its mark nonetheless.*

If a model rolls a natural 6 To Hit Smaug with a shooting attack, then makes a successful roll To Wound, Smaug suffers a number of wounds equal to the Strength value of the missile weapon used by the shooting model.

If Smaug Charges into combat and wins the ensuing Fight, all of his opponents are Knocked to the Ground, regardless of their size (except a War Mumak of Harad, Iron Hills Chariot, or any model that can never be knocked Prone). Furthermore, should Smaug choose to make a Barge Brutal Power Attack, any models forced to Back Away also suffer a Strength 9 hit.
