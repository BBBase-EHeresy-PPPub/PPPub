## FORCES OF EVIL

![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image190.jpeg)

## BARAD-DÛR

To the east of the realm of Gondor lies a land of perpetual darkness, known as Mordor. The skies are filled with choking clouds of volcanic ash from the mountain of fire, and the very air is a poisonous fume. It is a barren and harsh land where only the strongest can hope to survive. It is within this blighted realm that the Dark Lord Sauron rose to power during the Second Age of Middle-earth.

It was Sauron that gifted the rings of power to the Free Peoples of Middle-earth - three to the Elves, seven to the Dwarf lords, and nine to the race of Men. However, these rings were no mere gifts, for Sauron forged in secret a master ring, to control all others. It was through this ring of power that Sauron aimed to see to the fall of the kingdoms of Middle-earth. Those of the race of Men who received these rings soon fell into darkness, their rings taking over their minds and transforming them into puppets of the Dark Lord. No longer the great Men they once were, these beings soon became part of the shadow realm - neither living nor dead.

The ranks of Sauron's armies are made up of creatures bound to his will. Legions of Orc warriors swarm the plains of Mordor like ants, multiplying at a horrific speed and swelling the numbers of Sauron's forces. The bulk of these Orcs are the rank and file troops that Sauron will send directly into battle. Some Orcs have had some form of practice with their crude Orcish bows and fight at range. Some Orcs prefer to ride the vicious Wargs into battle, pouncing upon their enemies with unbridled ferocity and a constant lust for blood.

However, there are more than just Orcs within Sauron's ranks. There are some Men who bowed to Sauron willingly, turned to darkness by the promise of greatness and power. Foremost amongst these evil Men are the Black Numenoreans, elite fighters that form the vanguard of the armies of Mordor. Striding alongside the Men and Orcs of Mordor are the hulking Trolls, monstrous beasts whose muscular bodies are protected by thick scales and even thicker armour. Sent by Sauron to smash aside his enemies, the Trolls are one of the most fearsome creatures that Sauron commands.

During the Battle of the Last Alliance, Sauron himself entered the fray in order to turn the tide of the battle. Smashing aside his enemies with his dreaded mace, Sauron marched through rank upon rank of Men and Elves, leaving death in his wake. Strengthened by his Ring of Power, Sauron slew both Gil-galad, the High King of Elves, and Elendil, the King of Men. Only by separating the Ring from its master could its power be undone...

## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: The Dark Lord Sauron; The Witch-king of Angmar; Ringwraiths; Shelob; Orc Captains; Orc Shamans; Orc Taskmasters; Orc Drummers; Black Numenorean Marshalls; Mordor Troll Chieftains; Orc Warriors; Orc Trackers; Warg Riders; Black Numenoreans; Morgul Knights; Mordor Trolls; Mordor Siege Bows and Mordor War Catapults.

## ARMY BONUS

"The power of the Ring could not be undone" - Sauron's warband size is increased to 24. Additionally, a force that consists solely of models from the Barad-dur army list will never be considered Broken if Sauron has 3 or more Wounds remaining. Should Sauron have 2 or fewer Wounds remaining, the army will break as normal. Should Sauron be slain, the army will immediately count as being Broken.

### THE DARK LORD SAURON [400 POINTS]

Sauron is the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth and the Lord of the Rings. His desire to conquer and rule is unending, and he will not stop until he has dominated all of Middle-earth. Totally corrupt and driven by malice and cruelty, the Dark Lord wields his ultimate weapon, The One Ring. It is with this ring that Sauron conquered much of Middle-earth during the Second Age, and with it in his possession, no realm is safe from the destruction that he will bring upon them.
