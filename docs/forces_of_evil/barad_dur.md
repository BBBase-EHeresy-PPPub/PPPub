## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: The Dark Lord Sauron; The Witch-king of Angmar; Ringwraiths; Shelob; Orc Captains; Orc Shamans; Orc Taskmasters; Orc Drummers; Black Numenorean Marshalls; Mordor Troll Chieftains; Orc Warriors; Orc Trackers; Warg Riders; Black Numenoreans; Morgul Knights; Mordor Trolls; Mordor Siege Bows and Mordor War Catapults.

## ARMY BONUS

**"The power of the Ring could not be undone"** - Sauron's warband size is increased to 24. Additionally, a force that consists solely of models from the Barad-dur army list will never be considered Broken if Sauron has 3 or more Wounds remaining. Should Sauron have 2 or fewer Wounds remaining, the army will break as normal. Should Sauron be slain, the army will immediately count as being Broken.

### THE DARK LORD SAURON [400 POINTS]
*SPIRIT, MORDOR, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF LEGEND*

| Mv | F | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6" | 9/4+ | 8 | 10 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 6 | 6* | ** |

**WARGEAR**

- [Heavy armour]
- [Mace]
- The One Ring
- ****The One Ring (PASSIVE)**

Sauron does not follow the normal rules for The One Ring. Instead, whilst he wields The One Ring, whenever Sauron loses his last Wound or would be removed as a casualty, roll a D6. On a 2+, the power of the Ring sustains him and he has a single Wound restored. During the Fight phase, Sauron will make this roll for each Wound suffered that would cause him to be removed as a casualty. Sauron may use Might to influence this roll.

**HEROIC ACTIONS**

- [Heroic Channelling]
- [Heroic Strike]
- [Heroic Strength]
- [Heroic Challenge]

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Ancient Evil]
- [Resistant to Magic]
- [Terror]
- **The Dark Lord (PASSIVE)**

If Sauron is in your force, he must be your leader

- ***The Lord of the Rings (PASSIVE)**

Sauron can spend a single point of Will each turn without reducing his own store.

- **Unstoppable! (BRUTAL POWER ATTACK)**

Instead of striking as normal, Sauron can instead make one Strength 8 hit on every enemy model involved in the same fight, including spear and pike supports.

- **The Flames of Evil (BRUTAL POWER ATTACK)**

Sauron makes a single Strike against a single Infantry or Cavalry model Engaged in the fight. If the model is a Cavalry model, then only the rider will be affected. If the model is 'fortunate' enough to survive, even if they did not suffer a Wound, then the target is also Set Ablaze - remember that this also inflicts one Strength 9 hit on the poor model that Sauron now has in his grasp.

**MAGICAL POWERS**

If the Witch-king has the Crown of Morgul, his Attack value is increased to 3. Additionally, whilst wearing the Crown of Morgul, the Witch-king of Angmar can choose to re-roll one dice when making Casting or Resist tests.

- **Morgul Blade (ACTIVE)**

Once per game, this model's controlling player may declare they are using their Morgul blade during the Fight phase before rolling To Wound. If a model is using a Morgul blade, they must direct all of their Strikes against a single target. An enemy that suffers a Wound from the Morgul blade is automatically slain, regardless of the number of Wounds on their profile. Heroes may use Fate to avoid these Wounds, but if even a single Wound is not saved, they are slain. If the model using the Morgul blade is mounted, they must use the rider's Attacks and Strength if using the Morgul blade.

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Harbinger of Evil]
- [Terror]
- [Will of Evil]

- **Might/Will/Fate**

When buying the Witch-king for your force, decide how many points of Might/Will/Fate to give him, up to the maximums shown in his profile. At his weakest, the Witch-king starts the game with no Might, no Fate and 10 points of Will, and costs 70 points. Each extra point of Might, Will or Fate costs an extra 5 points, so the Witch-king with 3 Might, 3 Fate and 20 Will points will cost 150 points, before any upgrades.
