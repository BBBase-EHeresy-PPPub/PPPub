- **The Price of Failure (PASSIVE)**

If your army contains both Azog and Yazneg, and the two are in base contact at the beginning of your Move phase, instead of rolling the dice to make a Courage test when your force is Broken, you can remove Yazneg from play. If you do so, Azog is considered to have automatically passed his Courage test and his Stand Fast! will affect the entire battlefield. Furthermore, if Yazneg is removed from play in this way then whilst Azog is still alive, all Hunter Orcs, Hunter Orc Captains, Fimbul the Hunter and Narzug re-roll failed Courage tests.
