## AZOG'S HUNTERS

Ever since his defeat at the Battle of Azanulbizar, over a hundred years before, Azog has thirsted for the blood of Thorin Oakenshield. His desire to exact a brutal and bloody revenge upon the heir of Erebor has all but consumed him, driving him to near madness. From his camp atop the ruined watchtower of Amon Sûl, Azog has sent out word of a price upon the head of Thorin and has gathered to him all manner of barbaric creatures to aid him in his crusade to wipe out the line of Durin.

The Pale Orc rides into battle upon his great White Warg, a huge and vicious beast that towers over Orc and Warg alike. Atop this beast, Azog leads his followers in the hunt for Thorin's Company. Alongside the Pale Orc rides his spawn, Bolg. Every bit as cruel and unrelenting as his father, it is Bolg who continues the chase for the Dwarves when Azog is summoned by the dark power that dwells in Dol Guldur — the true master of evil.

Azog's Hunters are made up of many packs of vile Hunter Orcs, cunning and silent killers that have become accustomed to tracking their targets across all manner of terrain. Alongside them ride the Fell Wargs, beasts of an untapped power. Their senses greater than those of their lesser kin, Fell Wargs make for a deadly addition to Azog's forces. There are even some Orcs brave, or foolish, enough to ride these vicious creatures, combining the skills of both warriors to create a threat that is much greater than the sum of its parts.

In the absence of either Azog or Bolg, the Hunter Orcs are led by their captains, ruthless veterans who are tasked with keeping their packs in line and doing the will of the Pale Orc. Many of these captains have found that their skills lend them to different roles within the ranks of the Hunter Orcs. Fimbul has proven himself to be an expert in tracking and riding atop a Fell Warg, and so it is he that leads the Warg Riders into war. Narzug has exceptional skill with a bow, even for an Orc without the training of an Elf or Man. Even Yazneg, despite all of his failures, has proven his worth at times, leading the initial pursuit of the Dwarves. It is quite possible that, without the intervention of the Elves of Rivendell, Yazneg would have returned to Azog with the head of Thorin in his hands and the quest of the company would have failed.
