## ANGMAR

### OVERVIEW
There are many barren and forsaken lands within Middle-earth, ruled by evil and plagued by ill fortune and foul creatures. The greatest of these is the kingdom of Angmar in the north, for this cruel realm is the stronghold of the Witch-king, Sauron's chief servant and the lord of the Nazgul.

It was from the realm of Angmar that the Witch-king unleashed his fury upon the northern kingdoms of Middle-earth. The Witch-king was able to use his dark powers to bind tortured spirits to his will, unleashing creatures of nightmare upon his foes, leading to the fall of the once-great kingdom of Arnor. Hordes of Orcs and ghostly spirits marched upon the capital, Fornost, bringing destruction and death.

Although he was eventually defeated and routed from his holds in the north, the Witch-king endured. At the end of the Third Age, there are still packs of Orcs and Wargs, bands of Trolls, and whispers of unnatural beings lingering within the shadows of Angmar.

Within the ruins of Angmar, spectres tempt travelers to their doom, tortured spirits are still bound to the will of the Witch-king, and Barrow-wights hold court within the ruins. Hidden within Angmar lies Gulavhar, a demon of the ancient world, drawn to the dark power of the Witch-king.
