Every time a Hero model within 6" of The Dwimmerlaik spends a point of Might, Will or Fate, The Dwimmerlaik may elect to spend a point of Will. If he does, roll a D6. On a 4+, the enemy Hero model must spend an additional point (of the same type) or the deed will be cancelled and any Might, Will or Fate already committed will be lost. Note that a Hero model that wishes to expend multiple points of Might, Will or Fate, may wait to see how The Dwimmerlaik's roll affects their first point of Might, Will or Fate, before committing to spending any more. The Dwimmerlaik will have to spend a point of Will for every point he wishes to affect, though he may wait to see how his first point of Will affected his opponent before deciding to spend another point of Will.
