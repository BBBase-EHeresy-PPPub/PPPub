## MORDOR

Many years have passed since Sauron's defeat at the hands of the Last Alliance, yet his evil was not vanquished forever. For since the Ring endured, so did Sauron's will. Atop his tower in Barad-dur, Sauron's gaze pierces all - a great eye wreathed in flame, lidless and ever watching. He has spent much of the Third Age regaining his former strength, secretly growing his armies into the formidable force they once were, that one day he might come forth from Mordor and reclaim The One Ring.

At the time that the Ring of Power has awoken, the Nine have been sent forth from Minas Morgul in search of the Dark Lord's ultimate weapon, their sole purpose to locate its whereabouts and to kill the one who carries it. As Sauron's will has lost none of its potency, the Nine have been able to regain their strength, taking on the guise of the Black Riders - a truly terrifying sight that will chill the hearts of their enemies. Scouring the lands of Middle-earth, the Black Riders search both from horseback and from atop their Fell Beasts, terrifying creatures whose screech will freeze the hearts of even the boldest of warriors.

Within the many strongholds of Mordor, the armies of Sauron have grown enormously. Minas Morgul now seethes with Orcs and other foul creatures, ready to burst forth and conquer the lands outside Mordor. The plains of Gorgoroth have been filled with countless evil beings, legions of Mordor Uruk-hai hunger to spill the blood of the Free Peoples and huge monstrous Trolls roam the plateau eager to cause the destruction that comes so naturally to them.

In the north-west of Mordor looms the Black Gate, known as the Morannon, a huge fortification blocking the path into the black lands. Here reside the Morannon Orcs - stronger, better equipped and much more brutal than the mindless rabble that make up the bulk of Sauron's armies. The leader of the Morannon is Gothmog, a ruthless and barbaric Orc who possesses knowledge of battle tactics far beyond most Orcs and even Men. It is Gothmog that will lead Sauron's armies against Gondor, marching them to the walls of Minas Tirith late in the Third Age.

Should any seek to strike out against him, however, it is not just Orcs that Sauron has at his disposal. High within the pass of Cirith Ungol dwells a hidden terror, Shelob, the child of Ungoliant. Sauron is quite content to leave Shelob at peace, for those who venture into her lair are seldom heard from again.

It is these forces that Sauron intends to unleash upon Middle-earth in the dying years of the Third Age, for he is determined to regain The One Ring and finish the work he began millennia ago.
