**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Terror]
- [Throw Stones] (range 12", Strength 8).
- **Keep 'em for Later (ACTIVE)**

If this Troll wins a Fight, they may choose one Man-sized (or smaller) model from the Fight and Keep 'em for Later instead of rolling for Strikes or using a Brutal Power Attack. Replace the model with a 25mm marker that represents the unfortunate victim stuffed in a bag. The model thereafter counts as being subject to the Paralyse Magical Power.

- **Mince 'em Fine (BRUTAL POWER ATTACK)**

When Bill wins a Fight, he may choose to perform a Mince 'em Fine Brutal Power Attack instead of making Strikes. Choose one enemy model in the Fight – both Bill and the chosen model roll a D6 and add their respective Strength values. If Bill rolls higher, the victim suffers a number of Wounds equal to the difference – each of which may be prevented by a Fate point in the usual way. Regardless of who rolls higher, the victim Backs Away as normal.
