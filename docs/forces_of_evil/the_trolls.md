## THE TROLLS

Stone Trolls often dwell in The Misty Mountains; hulking and vicious creatures that relish causing pain to those they encounter. Yet these creatures have one distinct weakness — the sun. Should a Stone Troll be caught within the sun's rays, they will quickly find themselves transmogrifying into the very substance that the mountain they herald from is made of.

Bill, Bert, and Tom are three such creatures. Venturing down from the mountains, further than any Stone Trolls had done in an Age, the Three Trolls set up camp at the aptly named Trollshaws. Quite how long they had spent in their dwellings remains unknown, but they had managed to build up an impressive hoard of treasure, weapons (including Sting, Glamdring, and Orcrist) and, of course, gold.

The Trolls had raided the surrounding areas for food, feasting upon the local people, livestock, and whatever else they could get their giant grubby hands on.

It is these three Trolls that the company of Thorin Oakenshield encounter as they make their way towards The Misty Mountains. Rushing out to save their burglar from being scoffed by the squabbling Trolls, the Dwarves then find themselves caught and bagged up by these creatures, ready to be cooked and eaten, as well. If it wasn't for Bilbo's quick and clever thinking, the company would surely have perished; for the Hobbit's stalling tactics bought enough time for Gandalf to return to the company's rescue — smiting stone and drenching the Trolls in sunlight, and thus sealing their fate.
