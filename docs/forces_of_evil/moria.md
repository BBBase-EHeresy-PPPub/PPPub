# MORIA

Since the fall of Khazad-dum and the death of Durin, the great Dwarven kingdom of Moria has fallen into ruin and now lies in the clutches of the vile Moria Goblins and the creatures under their control. The splendour of Moria is all but erased and the Dwarven city of Dwarrowdelf now lies crumbling and in darkness. Torches have been replaced with cobwebs and the mines resemble more of a tomb than a lord's hall.

The fate of Durin came at the fault of the Dwarves themselves, for in their efforts to continue to dig into the core of the mountain in search of precious material, they awoke something in the darkness. A demon from the ancient world wreathed in both shadow and flame; a Balrog of Morgoth buried beneath Moria since the great wars of the First Age. This terrible foe slaughtered all of the Dwarves in its path before slaying the mighty Dwarf King and conquering Moria, leaving it to the mercy of the Goblins who ravaged and defiled the once great Dwarven realm. Should the Balrog ever be roused from its slumber again, it will take a being of comparable power to stop the evil it spreads.

Over the years since the fall of Moria, many Goblins have taken upon themselves the role of 'king', murdering and betraying their way to the top of the creatures' hierarchy. The greatest of these is Durburz, a Goblin king with more guile than any who came before him. Using the deceitful skills of his followers, Durburz was able to work his way up to rule in Moria and silence any that opposed his leadership. Since then, Durburz has ruled the mountain halls with an iron fist, showing no mercy to those who would dare to stand against him.

The Goblins that have taken up residence within Moria's halls are a vile and cunning race. While they could not hope to match the Dwarves one-on-one, their superior numbers and ability to scale the walls and caverns with incredible dexterity meant that the Dwarves were often overwhelmed and unable to fend off their would-be attackers. When the hordes of Goblins were not enough to oust the Dwarven defenders, the task fell to the Moria Blackshields, a tougher and more vicious breed of Goblins that relishes the opportunity to tear into the ranks of the enemy to break armor and spill blood.

## HEROES OF MORIA

### THE BALROG [350 POINTS]

**SPIRIT, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF LEGEND**

As the Dwarves of Moria delved deep in search of the riches that lay beneath the mountains, they awoke something terrible in the darkness - shadow and flame. The Balrog came forth from its slumber, slaughtering the Dwarves that had dared to rouse it. The Balrog even slew the noble Dwarf King, Durin, forever earning it the moniker of Durin's Bane. This giant beast is formed of living fire and is one of the most deadly foes that any warrior could ever be faced with. Able to conjure weapons of wicked flame, there is no mortal within Middle-earth that could ever hope to endure such a creature, and even those of an older power would be sorely tested against its might should their paths ever cross.

#### WARGEAR
- Giant flaming [Sword]
- a fiery lash

#### SPECIAL RULES
- Ancient Evil, Fearless, Resistant to Magic, Terror.
- Goblin Mastery - Such is the fear that the Balrog commands within the Goblins of Moria they will fight to ensure they do not feel its fiery wrath.
- Flame of Udun - The Balrog is wreathed in flame, able to manifest weapons of sorcerous fire.
- The Balrog is never considered to be unarmed and any model that suffers a Wound from the Balrog's Strikes (even if it is subsequently saved by Fate) and not slain must roll a D6. On a 6, the model suffers the Set Ablaze special rule. Additionally, the Balrog is immune to any fire-based attacks or special rules, such as a Dragon's Breathe Fire or the Set Ablaze special rule.
- Demon of the Ancient World - A demon from a bygone age, the power that flows through the Balrog is a nigh unstoppable force.
- The Balrog may call a Heroic Combat each turn without the need to expend a point of Might. Additionally, special rules and Strikes that would slay the Balrog instantly (such as Drain Soul or a Morgul blade) will only inflict half of the Balrog's starting Wounds rather than all of them.
- Friendly Moria Goblin models within 12" of the Balrog automatically pass Courage tests.
