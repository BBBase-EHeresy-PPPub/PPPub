### THE BALROG [350 POINTS]
*SPIRIT, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO - HERO OF LEGEND*

| Mv |  F  | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:---:|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 6" | 10/3+ | 9 | 9 | 4 | 10 | 7 | 0 | 10 | 0 |

**WARGEAR**

- Giant flaming sword
- Fiery lash

- **Fiery lash** `ACTIVE`

This is a throwing weapon with a range of 8" and a Strength of 7. Additionally, a model that is hit by this weapon and not slain is dragged directly towards and into base contact with the Balrog, even over intervening models or terrain. If the model cannot be placed where it should be placed, instead place it in base contact with the Balrog as close as possible to the position it should have been in. If, for whatever reason, the model cannot be placed anywhere in base contact, then it is not moved at all.

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Ancient Evil]
- [Fearless]
- [Resistant to Magic]
- [Terror]
- **Goblin Mastery** `PASSIVE`

Friendly Moria Goblin models within 12" of the Balrog automatically pass Courage tests.

- **Flame of Udun** `PASSIVE`

The Balrog is never considered to be unarmed and any model that suffers a Wound from the Balrog's Strikes (even if it is subsequently saved by Fate) and not slain must roll a D6. On a 6, the model suffers the Set Ablaze special rule. Additionally, the Balrog is immune to any fire-based attacks or special rules, such as a Dragon's Breathe Fire or the Set Ablaze special rule.

- **Demon of the Ancient World** `PASSIVE`

The Balrog may call a Heroic Combat each turn without the need to expend a point of Might. Additionally, special rules and Strikes that would slay the Balrog instantly (such as Drain Soul or a Morgul blade) will only inflict half of the Balrog's starting Wounds rather than all of them.

- **Protect the Nest** `ACTIVE`

At the start of the game, before any models have been deployed, the Cave Drake's controlling player may place a single 25mm Nest marker per Cave Drake (the eggs that come in the Cave Drake set are ideal for this) anywhere on the board. Whilst within 3" of a Nest marker, a Cave Drake gains the Fearless special rule.

- **Gaping Maw (BRUTAL POWES ATTACK)**

Instead of striking normally, the Cave Drake may select a single Man-sized (or smaller) model involved in the same fight to attempt to swallow whole. Roll a D6. On a 3+, the model is swallowed whole and is removed as a casualty.

Fate rolls may be made against this Brutal Power Attack as if it has caused a Wound, but if a model fails to save this with Fate it will be slain.

### THE WATCHER IN THE WATER [200 POINTS]
*KRAKEN, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO - INDEPENDENT HERO*

| Mv | F | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 4" | 6/3+ | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 1 |

**WARGEAR**

- Tentacles

**HEROIC ACTIONS**

- [Heroic Strength]

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Harbinger of Evil]
- [Resistant to Magic]
- [Terror]
- **From the Deep** `ACTIVE`

The Watcher in the Water can never be part of another Hero model's warband. When you deploy your army, do not deploy the Watcher in the Water on the board - instead keep it to one side for later. During each Priority phase, after Priority has been rolled, announce if you would like the Watcher to arrive and if yes, roll a D6. On a 3+, the Watcher is ready to enter play. Once you have declared the Watcher is ready to enter, you must roll during each Priority phase thereafter until it is available.

When the Watcher is ready to enter play, immediately place it anywhere on the battlefield - it can displace models. Move any displaced models the minimum distance possible so that they are 1" away from the Watcher (or as close as this situation will allow). In this situation, players take it in turns to displace models, starting with the Watcher's controlling player. This may create some odd situations, but represents the Watcher bursting forth, scattering warriors both friend and foe alike. The Watcher cannot charge on the turn it arrives.

- **Many Tentacles** `PASSIVE`

When the Watcher is reduced to 3 or less Wounds remaining, its Attacks are also reduced to 3.

- **Tentacles** `ACTIVE`

In the Shoot phase, the Watcher may make D6 shooting attacks. These have a range of 6" and a Strength of 3, and never require In The Way rolls. Any model hit by a tentacle, but not slain, is immediately dragged into base contact with the Watcher by the shortest route possible, even over the heads of other models. Models moved in this way do not count as having charged. If there is no way to fit the model in base contact, it is not moved at all. The Watcher can still make these shooting attacks even if it is Engaged in combat.

- **Water Dweller** `PASSIVE`

The Watcher is not slowed when entering a water feature. In fact, whilst within one, its Move value is doubled and it always counts as having rolled a 6 on the Swim chart. Additionally, if the Watcher charges whilst within a Water Feature, it gains the Monstrous Charge special rule.

- **Dragged to the Depth (BRUTAL POWER ATTACK)**

Instead of striking normally, if the Watcher in the Water is within a water feature it can select a single Man-sized or smaller model involved in the same fight, and then roll a D6. On a 3+, that model suffers a Wound (Fate rolls can be made as usual). If the Wound is not saved, the model is dragged to the depths and immediately slain. The Watcher is then removed from the board and its controlling player will start to roll for the Watcher to re-arrive as described in the From the Deep special rule on this page.

The Drum has no Control Zone and any enemy model that spends a full turn in base contact with the Drum, without doing anything else (such as shooting, using a Magical Power or fighting in combat), may immediately destroy the Drum as described above.

- **Take up the Drum** `PASSIVE`

If either of the Drummers are slain, they may pass on their wargear to any other unengaged Moria Goblin Warrior within 1" - immediately replace the model with the slain Drummer. Models that take up the Drummer's wargear will automatically drop any that they are carrying.

- **Drums in the Deep** `ACTIVE`

A Moria Goblin Drum takes up two spaces within a warband and counts as two models towards the army. It is deployed in the same way as the rest of the warband.

For the Drum to be played, at least one Moria Goblin Drummer must have started the turn in base contact with the Drum, and also not be Engaged in a Fight. When the Drum is being played, it has the following effects:

All Fights within 18" of one or more Drums, that also include at least one friendly Moria Goblin model, may re-roll a single D6 for their Duel roll. Note that this is not cumulative with the effects of a banner.

All friendly Moria Goblin models on the battlefield add 1 to their Courage value, and all enemy models suffer a -1 penalty to their Courage value. Note that this is not cumulative with other rules that confer similar modifiers.

The Drum is a Heavy Object and as such is moved exactly like one. The Drum cannot be played in a turn in which it has moved.

A Warg Marauder is an interesting Cavalry model in that it has three Moria Goblins riding upon a single Warg, one with a shield and two with a bow. This model is treated the same as any other Cavalry model with the following exceptions:

Whilst the Goblin with a shield is still alive and mounted upon the Warg, all of the parts of the Cavalry model gain the bonus of + 1 to their Defence.

The Warg Marauder only counts as one model towards an army's Bow Limit.

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **On the Hunt** `ACTIVE`

A Warg Marauder can always fire an Orc bow shot for each Goblin with an Orc bow that is alive upon the back of the Warg, even if it has moved its full movement or is Engaged in a Fight.

- **Lethal Union** `PASSIVE`

Whilst the Goblins remain mounted upon the Warg, the entire model gains the Terror special rule and adds a bonus of + 1 to its Courage value. Additionally, in combat a Warg Marauder may make an additional Attack for each Goblin after the first that is still mounted upon the Warg, so long as they did not shoot during the Shoot phase.
