## FORCES OF EVIL

## AZOG'S LEGION

Marching upon the kingdoms of Erebor and Dale, Azog's legions spill forth from the cesspits of Dol Guldur eager for the sound of battle and the taste of blood. As the bitter rivalry between the feuding Elves and Dwarves comes to a head, Azog unleashes his legions upon his unsuspecting enemies, the giant were-wyrms that lay beneath the plains of Erebor providing passage for Azog's vast legions of Orcs and other foul creatures.

From atop his signal tower, Azog can observe the ever-changing ebb and flow of the battle that rages on beneath him, allowing him to use his tactical mind to react to the battle as it changes. Using his signal tower, Azog commands his forces with a combination of banners and horns, alerting his troops to a change in tactics or to execute a specific manoeuvre.

The bulk of Azog's armies are made up of the vicious Orcs from Dol Guldur and Gundabad. Clad in thick, crude armour, these Orcs are veterans of the many wars with the Dwarves and Elves, the hatred of their races still etched into their brains. Desperate to spill the blood of their most bitter enemies, these Orcs are unleashed upon the ranks of Dwarves, Men and Elves, intent on destroying every single one of them.

It is not just Orcs that Azog commands — he also has a host of fearsome warbeasts at his disposal. Huge Trolls march forth from Gundabad, armed with crude wooden clubs or sharpened gauntlets used to cleave through enemy ranks with frightening ease. Some Trolls are so large, they can be fitted with a whole catapult upon their back. It is these that Azog uses to smash through the walls of Dale, allowing his warriors to flood the city. Although not as big as Trolls, Ogres are an imposing threat, smashing aside Dwarves and Men in order to bring death to Azog's enemies.

From the north, a second army approaches. Bolg has ridden to Mount Gundabad in order to bring forth the vast legions that lie within the fortress' iron walls. Alongside the numerous Gundabad Orc Warriors run the Gundabad Berserkers, hulking Orcs wielding brutal and wicked-looking weapons. War Bats flock from the caves of the mountains. These dread creatures have been bred specifically for war and their razor-sharp talons will see to the deaths of Dwarves and Elves alike.

It is these forces that Azog believes will secure a bloody and decisive victory, allowing for the kingdom of Angmar to rise again and bring terror back to the north, as well as letting the Pale Orc finally settle an old score and erase the line of Durin for good.
