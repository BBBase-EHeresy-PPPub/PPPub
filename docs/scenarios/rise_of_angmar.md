## THE FOUNDING OF ANGMAR

LAYOUT

The board represents an Arnor stronghold in the northern reaches of Rhudaur. The board should have plenty of buildings on it, as well as the odd tree and bush dotted around. The largest building should be placed in the centre of the board.

SPECIAL RULES

Legions of the Witch-king - *The Lord of the Nazgul has gathered to him hordes of Orcs, which continuously assail the Arnor stronghold.*

Whenever an Evil Warrior model is slain, keep them to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase roll a D6 for each model kept aside in this manner. On a 4+, that model may enter the board from the eastern board edge or the centre of either the northern or southern board edges.

Rising Power - *The Witch-king\'s influence in the north is growing and, as it does, so too does his strength.*

The Witch-king increases his Attacks to 2 for this Scenario.

Hold the Line - *With the armies of Angmar all around, the small garrison of Arnor warriors know that their best chance of survival is to try to hold what they have.*

Good models may not willingly move further than 12\" away from the centre of the board. If a Good model finds itself further than 12\" from the centre of the board at the start of its Move phase, it must try to move back within 12\" if possible.

Unknown Attackers - *The forces of Arnor have been assailed by an unknown force, one that they have little to no knowledge of.*

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their force within 6\" of the centre of

Evil Hero models may declare a 1 leroic March each turn without reducing their own store of Might.

height="6.656944444444444in"}

The board represents an area of Rhudaur on the edges of one

of the many fortifications ruined by the assault of the Angmar army. As such, the board should have a selection of ruins, as well as a few trees, bushes and hedges dotted around, providing plenty of cover.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their models within 6\" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then deploys their models anywhere on the board at least 6\" away from any Good model.

OBJECTIVES

Those that refused to bow to the Witch-king must flee the lands of Rhudaur if they wish to live. The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one side completes their objective. The Good side wins if five or more Good models can escape the board via any board edge. The Evil player wins if they can kill enough Good models to make it impossible for the Good side to win.

## DEFENCE OF TYRN GORTHAD


LAYOUT

The board represents an area near one of the old burial grounds in Tyrn Gorthad. There should be a selection of mounds within 12" of the centre of the board. The rest of the board should be dotted with trees, bushes and hedges providing plenty of cover.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their models within 6\" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then splits their force into four quarters as equally as possible, and then deploys each quarter within 6\" of the centre of a different board edge.

SPECIAL RULES

Stand your Ground! - *The Rangers know that their best chance of survival is to stay within the confines of the burial ground, rather than face the Orcs on their terms.*

Good models may not voluntarily move more than 6\" away from the centre of the board. If a Good model finds itself outside of 6", then it must move back within range as quickly as possible.

Twilight - *The Orcs have attacked just as the sun is setting, and visibility is beginning to become more difficult.*

Models that target an enemy model with a shooting attack that is more than 12" away suffer a -1 penalty to their Shoot value.

A Desperate Fight - *Surrounded on all sides, the Rangers of the North must give their all if they are to survive.*

Rangers of the North have 2 Attacks in this Scenario.

PARTICIPANTS

![](media/image30.jpeg){width="7.803472222222222in"
height="5.233333333333333in"}

OBJECTIVES

The Rangers are making a desperate stand within Tyrn Gorthad, and must drive the Orcs back if they are to survive.

The game lasts until the end of any turn in which one player completes their objective. The Good player wins if they can reduce the Evil force to 25% or less of its starting numbers (8 models). The Evil player wins if they can kill all of the Dunedain and Rangers of the North. If both players achieve their objective in the same turn, the game is a draw.

## FALL OF AMON SUL

LAYOUT

The board represents the tower of Amon Sul and the surrounding area. The area within 6\" of the centre of the board is the tower. The rest of the board should be relatively clear, with the odd tree, hedge and bush dotted around.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their force within 3\" of the tower of Amon Sul. The Evil player then deploys their force anywhere on the board at least 12\" away from any Good model.

OBJECTIVES

Arveleg has gathered his forces to defend Amon Sul against the Witch-king, who has come to destroy the tower and claim the Palantir that lies within.

The game lasts for 12 turns. The Good player wins if the Palantir leaves the board via any board edge. The Evil player wins if Arveleg has been slain and the Palantir is not in the possession of a Good model. Any other result is a draw.

SPECIAL RULES

The Tower of Amon Sul - *After retrieving the Palantir, the tower has been locked to prevent the forces of Angmar from getting inside.*

Models cannot enter, or be deployed within, the tower of Amon Sul.

The Palantir - *Arveleg knows that the Witch-king seeks the Palantir of Amon Sul, and so he has entrusted one of his followers to escape with the stone to Fornost.*

At the start of the game, the Good player secretly notes down one of their models (with the exception of Arveleg); this is the model that is carrying the Palantir. The Palantir is a Light Object that can never be passed. If the model carrying the Palantir is slain, then the Palantir is dropped rather than being immediately claimed. At this point the location of the Palantir becomes known to the Evil player. If the model carrying the Palantir escapes the board, then the game immediately ends.

Defiance of the King - *Arveleg knows that there is little hope for himself, yet he will face the Witch-king and his dark sorceries head on nonetheless.*

Arveleg has the Resistant to Magic special rule, and may re-roll failed Fate rolls. Additionally, Arveleg gains the Arnor keyword.

Rising Power - *The Witch-king\'s influence in the north is growing and, as it does, so too does his strength.*

The Witch-king increases his Attacks to 2 for this Scenario.

PARTICIPANTS

> GOOD: Arveleg (King of Men with heavy armour and > shield); 2 Captains of Arnor; 24 Warriors of Arnor;

## DEFENCE OF FORNOST

LAYOUT

The board represents the walls of the city of Fornost.

The walls are 3\" wide and run along the western board edge.

The rest of the board should be relatively barren with the odd tree, bush or hedge dotted around.

SPECIAL RULES

Ruthless Attackers - *Having already destroyed Amon Sul, the Angmar forces are brimming with confidence to assail Fornost and throw themselves at the battlements with an unbridled fury.*

Evil models that are fighting from a ladder do not treat the battlements as a barrier if they win the fight; they will Strike as normal.

The King is Dead - *With Arveleg lost at Amon Sul, hope is fading and the Men of Arnor fear that the city may fall.*

Evil models that are on the walls cause Terror.

PARTICIPANTS

GOOD: 2 Captains of Arnor; 16 Warriors of Arnor;

8.  Rangers of Arnor.

## MARAUDING OF CARDOLAN

LAYOUT

The board represents the ravaged lands of Cardolan. There should be plenty of ruins across the board, as well as plenty of trees, bushes and hedges dotted around the board.

SPECIAL RULES

A Skilled Fighter - *The Prince of Cardolan has fought in many wars and proved his proficiency with a blade over and over again.*

The Prince of Cardolan has 3 Attacks rather than 2 and has the Hatred (Angmar) special rule.

Defend the Prince - *The Men of Cardolan will fight with all they can give in order to protect their liege. Should the prince be in trouble, their efforts will be redoubled.*

The board represents the lands outside Fornost. There should be plenty of trees, hedges, and bushes scattered around the board, with the odd building or ruin dotted between them.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Evil player deploys their models within 12\" of the western board edge. The Good player then deploys their models within 12\" of the eastern board edge.

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one side has completed their objective. The Good side wins if they can reduce the Evil side to 25% or less of their starting numbers (13 models). The Evil side wins if they can reduce the Good side to 25% or less of their starting numbers (7 models). If both sides achieve their objective in the same turn, the game is a draw.

## THE GREAT PLAGUE

LAYOUT

The board represents the lands of Cardolan. The board should be covered in a variety of ruins, trees, bushes and hedges providing a densely packed board of terrain for models to traverse around.

SPECIAL RULES

The Great Plague - *Sickness is rife within Cardolan, afflicting Men and Orcs with debilitating symptoms and causing many to succumb to the illness.*

From turn 2 onwards, at the start of the Move phase, roll a D6 for each model left on the board. On the roll of a 1 the Great Plague has taken hold and the model suffers a Wound. Might may not be used to influence this roll, however, Fate points may be spent as normal. Spirit models are not affected by this Special rule; do not roll for them.

Make Haste! - *The survivors of Cardolan know the paths of their lands well, and must traverse them swiftly if they are to survive.*

Good models gain the Woodland Creature and Mountain Dweller special rules.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their models within 12\" of the centre of the southern board edge. The Evil player deploys the

Spectres within 6\" of the centre of the northern board edge, and then splits the rest of their models into two equal halves. One half is deployed within 6\" of the centre of the eastern board edge, and the other is deployed within 6\" of the centre of the western board edge.

The game lasts until one side has completed their objective. The Good player wins if three or more Good models escape the board via the northern board edge. The Evil player wins if enough Good models are slain to make it impossible for the Good player to achieve their objective.

OBJECTIVES

The survivors of Cardolan have abandoned their homes and are now trying to reach the realm of Arthedain for safety. However, they must do so before they succumb to the Orcs, or the Great Plague.

## RAISING OF THE BARROW-DOWNS


LAYOUT

The board represents the Barrow-downs. There should be four barrows on the board, each one placed within 12\" of a different corner of the board. There should also be plenty of trees around the edges of the board. The rest of the board should be relatively clear, with the odd hedge or bush dotted around.

STARTING POSITIONS

SPECIAL RULES

Fog on the Barrow-downs - *The mists that have descended on the Barrow-downs make it hard for the Men of Cardolan to see.*

Man models can only see up to 6".

LAYOUT

The board represents the lands outside the city of Fornost. Along the western board edge are the walls of Fornost. The area within 12\" of the eastern board edge should be lined with trees. The rest of the board should have the odd tree, hedge and bush dotted around.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their force within 6\" of the centre of the western board edge. The Evil player deploys their force within 12\" of the eastern board edge.

OBJECTIVES

Arvedui must lead his armies to ensure that the city doesn\'t fall, and must kill enough of the army of Cam Dum to force them to fall back.

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one side has completed their objective. The Good player wins if they can reduce the Evil force to 25% or less of their starting numbers (13 models).

## THE FALL OF ARNOR

LAYOUT

The centre of the board represents the ruined palace of Fornost, whilst the remainder of the board represents the surviving ruins of the city. The board should be covered in ruins and piles of rocks towards the edges, and much more substantial buildings towards the centre.

SPECIAL RULES

Malbeth the Seer - *Malbeth knows that the doom of*

*Arnor is upon his king and so puts all of his visions to use in protecting his liege.*

Whenever Arvedui suffers a Wound within 6\" of Malbeth, he will ignore the Wound on a 4+ rather than a 5+.

Arvedui\'s Last Stand - *Arvedui knows that if he does not stand and fight this threat from the north then his kingdom shall be thrust into destruction and ruin.*

Arvedui has the Fearless special rule.

STARTING POSITIONS

![](media/image58.png){width="7.290277777777778in"
height="5.129861111111111in"}

The Good player deploys all of their models anywhere within 6\" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then deploys their models anywhere within 6\" of any board edge.

OBJECTIVES

The forces of Angmar have been given a single task, to wipe out the royal lineage of Arnor and claim Fornost for the Witch-king. Arvedui must survive this onslaught if his line is to endure, for a much larger army of fouler creatures draws ever nearer.

The Evil player wins immediately if all of Arvedui, Aranarth and Malbeth are slain. The Good player wins if the Evil force is wiped out before this can happen. Alternatively, the game is a draw if Arvedui abandons Fornost and manages to escape the board via any board edge - and if the battle is going ill, this may be a good idea!

## FLIGHT TO THE NORTH

LAYOUT

The board represents the northern lands of Arnor.

There should be plenty of mins, trees, hedges and other undergrowth covering the board, providing plenty of cover and interesting pathways across the board.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their force within 6\" of the southern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their models touching any of the northern, eastern or western board edges, but not within 6\" of a Good model. Gulavhar is not deployed at the beginning of the game but will be available as the game progresses.

OBJECTIVES

Arvedui must escape the evil that now hunts him if he is to ensure that the Palantiri do not fall into enemy hands.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The Good side wins immediately if Arvedui can escape the board via the northern board edge. The Evil side wins if they manage to reclaim the Palantiri and move them off any board edge.

At the start of the game Arvedui is in possession of the Palantiri. This is a Light Object that cannot be passed and cannot be dropped unless the model carrying it is slain. If a model carrying the Palantiri is slain in combat, the model that slew them does not automatically gain possession of the Palantiri. Instead it will be dropped where the model stood. If a Good model, other than Arvedui, can move the Palantiri off the board via the northern board edge then the game ends immediately and is a draw.

## AID TO FORNOST

Good models gain the Woodland Creature special rule.

EVIL: Angmar Orc Captain with shield; 12 Angmar Orc Warriors: 4 with shield, 4 with spear, 2 with two-handed weapon, 2 with Orc bow.

Sure-footed - *The Rangers and Hobbits know the paths they are traversing far better than their Orc counterparts, and can move far easier through the trees.*

Evil models begin the game as Sentries as described in the main rules manual.

LAYOUT

The board represents the wooded lands between the Shire and Fornost. The board should be covered with plenty of trees, hedges and other undergrowth to provide lots of cover.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Evil player places their models within 3\" of the centreline of the board that mns from east to west. The Good player then deploys their models within 6\" of the southern board edge.

OBJECTIVES

The Hobbits must make their way northwards and past the Orcs if they are to provide aid to Earnur and his forces.

SPECIAL RULES

The Orc Pack - *The Orcs are unaware of the Hobbits trying to make their way northwards, and are simply hunting the woodland in search of the Witch-king\'s enemies.*

PARTICIPANTS

GOOD: 3 Rangers of the North; 12 Hobbit Archers.

The game lasts until one side has completed their objective. The Good side wins if 6 or more Hobbit models can move off the board via the northern board edge. The Evil side wins if they can kill enough Hobbit models to make it impossible for the Good player to achieve their objective.

## THE BATTLE OF FORNOST

LAYOUT

The board represents a section of the ruins of Fornost and the surrounding area. The north-eastern quarter of the board is the city of Fornost, and should have ruined walls surrounding it with plenty of ways through. The city of Fornost itself should contain plenty of ruins. The rest of the board should be dotted with trees, hedges, rocky outcrops and piles of rubble.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Evil player deploys their force within the north-eastern quarter of the board that makes up the city of Fornost. The Good player then deploys the Gondor contingent within 12\" of the south-western corner, the Rivendell contingent within 12\" of the south-eastern corner, and the Arnor contingent within 12\" of the north-western corner.

OBJECTIVES

This is the final battle for Fornost. The free peoples must either wipe out the Angmar force, or die in the attempt.

The game lasts until one force is wiped out, at which point the opposing side is the winner.

SPECIAL RULES

The Toll of Battle - A *battle of such magnitude will have consequences on the morale of all those that witness such death around them, and some may choose to flee the battle to ensure they live.*

In this Scenario, both forces will break in the same way as if it was a Matched Play game. The rules for Broken forces can be found in the main mles manual.

The Lord of the Nazgul - *The Witch-king is at the height of his power, and his armies will constantly push forward unless they want to feel his wrath.*

The Witch-king of Angmar has 3 Attacks in this Scenario. Additionally, whilst the Witch-king is alive and on the board, Evil models gain a bonus of + 1 to their Courage value. However, should the Witch-king be slain or flee the board, then the best result the Evil player can achieve is a draw.

Leaders of the Free Peoples - *Those that lead the armies of the free peoples have the unyielding loyalty of their followers, yet should they fall, hope will begin to fade.*

If Earnur, Glorfindel, Cirdan and Aranarth are all slain or have fled the board at the end of the game, the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

## FALL OF MINAS BTHIL
SPECIAL RULES

Controlling Objectives - *Capturing key areas of Minas Ithil will require large numbers to overwhelm the defenders and drive them backwards.*

The Evil force is considered to be controlling an Objective marker if there is at least twice as many Evil models within 3\" of it as there are Good models, or if there is at least one Evil model within 3\" and no Good models.

Legions of the Witch-king - *The Witch-king has gathered to him a huge army, and more flood through the gates of Minas Ithil as the battle rages on.*

Whenever an Evil Warrior model is slain, keep it to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase roll a D6 for each model kept aside in this manner. On a 4+ that model may enter the board from the centre of the western board edge via the rules for Reinforcements.

LAYOUT

The board represents the inside of the fortress of Minas Ithil. The western board edge should be the walls of the fortress, with the gates in the centre of the western board edge. The rest of the board should be littered with buildings, ruins and piles of rubble providing plenty of different pathways and cover for models to navigate. Place three Objective markers on the board. One is placed in the centre of the board. The next is placed halfway between the centre of the board and the north-eastern corner of the board, and the final one is placed halfway between the centre of the board and the south- eastern corner of the board.

OBJECTIVES

In order to conquer Minas Ithil, the Witch-king\'s forces must capture key areas of the fortress. The Men of Gondor know that they are hopelessly outnumbered, but if they can slay the Witch-king then his armies will flee.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The Good side wins immediately if the Witch-king is slain. The Evil side wins if at the end of any turn they are in control of all three Objective markers.

## LAST SIGHTING OF EARNUR

LAYOUT

The board represents the inside of the fortress of Minas Morgul. The western board edge should be the walls of the fortress, with the gates in the centre of the western board edge. The rest of the board should be littered with buildings, ruins and piles of rubble, providing plenty of different pathways and cover for models to navigate.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Evil player places the Witch-king 12\" from the centre of the eastern board edge. The Good player then places their models within 6\" of the centre of the western board edge. The Evil player then splits the rest of their force into two equal halves, then deploys one within 3 " of the northern board edge, and the other within 3\" of the southern board edge.

OBJECTIVES

Both Earnur and the Witch-king desire revenge against the other for the events of the Battle of Fornost all those years ago, and will not cease their attack until they have their vengeance.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The Good side wins immediately if the Witch-king is slain at the hands of Earnur. The Evil side wins immediately if Earnur is slain at the hands of the Witch-king.

SPECIAL RULES

The Witch-king has a Fight value of 6 and 3 Attacks in this Scenario.

Leave Him to Me - *The Garrison of Minas Morgul is under strict orders to allow the Witch-king to slay the King of Gondor.*

Evil models may not target Earnur with shooting attacks, special rules or Magical Powers.

A Clash of Kings - *Edrnur and the Witch-king are striving to prove their dominance, and must slay the other to achieve victory.*

If a model, other than Earnur or the Witch-king, causes a Wound to either Earnur or the Witch-king that would cause them to be slain, after Fate points have been spent, then the Wound is negated but any Fate points spent are lost.

Death or Glory - *Both the Witch-king and Earnur will fight fearlessly and without respite to achieve victory.*

Earnur gains the Fearless special rule in this Scenario. Additionally, the Witch-king does not give up a Will point for being involved in a combat during this Scenario.
