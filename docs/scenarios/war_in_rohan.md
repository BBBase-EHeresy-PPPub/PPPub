[]{#bookmark9 .anchor}BURNING OF THE
WESTFOLD

*S*][*aruman's allegiance to Sauron has
seen his armies swell in size, the union of the towers of Orthanc
and*

*Barad-dûr dramatically increasing the Wizard's power. Within the pits of Isengard a legion of Uruk-hai are being bred for war, armed with thick plate and sharp swords. Yet they are not the only warriors to fight for Saruman against the free peoples.*

*Saruman's war would strike first against the Kingdom of Rohan and this would be used to gain the sworn allegiance of the Dunlendings, who harbour a deep hatred for the Rohirrim who drove them from their lands many years ago. Under the orders of the White Wizard, the Dunlendings begin their attacks upon the lands of Rohan, burning any villages and settlements they come across, and slaughtering those in their
way.*

*The Dunlendings believe that the lands are theirs by right and so
they seek to take them back from the hated Forgoil by force, condemning the Rohirrim to the same fate they suffered years before. As the Dunlendings attack the villages of Rohan, they are met with resistance from the warriors of the Westfold who are intent on protecting their lands and people from the torches and blades of their foes. Though even as the Dunlendings burn their villages and hope seems lost, the leaders of the Rohirrim attempt to ride to Edoras to warn the king of Saruman's treachery.*

height="3.1930555555555555in"}

*SPECIAL RULES*

Warn the King -- *Should hope seem lost, and the village look as
though it will be overrun, it is the duty of those in charge to ride to
Edoras and warn Théoden of the attack.*

Once the Good side has been reduced to 50% or fewer of its starting models, any Captain of Rohan may try to escape the board to deliver news to Théoden. Should a Captain of Rohan escape the board via any table edge, the best result the Evil side can achieve is a draw.

Torching Buildings -- *The Dunlendings plan on setting as much of
the village alight to drive the Forgoil from their
lands.*

Any Dunlending model that ends its move in base contact with a Rohan house during the Move phase can attempt to set it alight. Roll a D6, on a 5+ the building has been set
alight.

Put the Fires Out! -- *As the buildings become engulfed in flame,
the Rohirrim attempt to subdue the fires and protect the
village.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents one of the many villages that make up the Westfold of Rohan and, as such, should have a selection of houses, fences and hedges dotted around the board. There should be a total of seven Rohan houses on the board, one in the centre and three in each of the eastern and western board
halves.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player splits their force into two equal halves, each containing one Captain. They then deploy one half anywhere within the western half of the board, and within 3" of any Rohan houses. They then deploy one half anywhere within the eastern half of the board, but within 3" of any Rohan houses. The Evil player then deploys The Wild Man Oathmaker and the Wild Men of Dunland anywhere within 6" of either the northern or southern board edge. The rest of the Evil models will become available as the game progresses.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Dunlendings are determined to take revenge on the Rohirrim and plan on burning their lands one settlement at a time. The Rohirrim must fend off their attackers and protect their homes from these invaders. The game lasts for 10 turns. If at the end of 10 turns, less than half of the Rohan houses are on fire, the Good player is the winner. If at the end of 10 turns, more than half of the Rohan houses are on fire, the Evil player is the
winner.

Any Good model that ends its move in base contact with a Rohan house that is on fire may attempt to put it out. Roll a D6, on the roll of a 6 the fire has been put out. However, should the Good player roll a 1 then the house will be consumed by flames and cannot be put out for the remainder of the
game.

Dunlending Reinforcements -- *The Wildmen are just the first of the Dunlendings to attack the village, more soon swarm the
battlefield.*

At the end of the Evil player's first Move phase, they may roll a D6 for each Dunlending model not yet in play. On a 3+ that model may enter play from any point on any board edge via the rules for Reinforcements. On a 1-2, that model may then roll again on the following turn, adding 1 to the
result.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: 2 Captains of Rohan with shield; 24 Warriors of Rohan: 8 with shield, 8 with throwing spear & shield, 8 with bow.

Evil: Gorûlf Ironskin; Frida Tallspear; The Wild Man Oathmaker; 12 Wild Men of Dunland; 6 Dunlending Warriors with shield; 6 Dunlending Warriors with
bow;

6 Dunlending Huscarls.

[]{#bookmark11 .anchor}FIRST BATTLEOF THE FORDS OF
ISEN

*T*][*he Dunlendings' attacks upon the
villages of the Westfold and the mustering of Saruman's armies in Isengard have not gone completely unnoticed by those within Rohan. News of the White Wizard's armies reached the ears of the prince of Rohan via his trusted scouts, and Théodred began to gather to him a force to take Saruman's armies by surprise at the Fords of
Isen.*

*However, Saruman had weaved a cunning ruse tricking the scouts into delivering information they believed to be true, but would instead lure Théodred into a trap. Upon arriving at the Fords of Isen, Théodred
ordered some of his men to stay back and protect the flanks as he and a band of followers crossed the Isen. It was here that Saruman's forces sprung
their trap, catching the prince of Rohan unawares and leaving him stranded on the fords and away from the support of his
armies.*

*With Théodred engaged in a fight for his life against the Uruk-hai
and Dunlendings, Grimbold makes haste to his prince's side, bringing his Helmingas with him to the fight. Yet even as things look hopeless, news
of Isengard's attack upon the fords has reached Elfhelm who now rides with his Éored to Théodred's aid. If the Rohirrim cannot prevent the
Uruk-hai from crossing the Fords of Isen, then Saruman will control the path
into Rohan and Théodred shall surely be
slain.*

height="3.1930555555555555in"}

*OBJECTIVES*

The forces of Saruman have been tasked with slaying the young prince and securing the fords, allowing Saruman's armies an easier route into Rohan. The game lasts for 12 turns. The Evil player wins if they can slay Théodred and get 12 or more models onto the eastern side of the board by the time the game ends. The Good player wins if they can prevent both of these from happening. If the Evil player only completes one of their objectives, the game is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

The River Isen -- *The river is deep and fast-flowing, crossing it at
any other point than the ford could prove to be
difficult.*

The river is counted as deep water for all
purposes.

Théodred's Doom -- *Saruman has commanded that Théodred must be slain. His death will see the king fall into
despair.*

Evil models must re-roll failed To Wound rolls against Théodred in the Fight phase.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the Fords of Isen. There should be a river that is 6" wide flowing down the centre of the board from north to south. In the middle of the river is the ford, a 6" wide area in the centre of the river that can be crossed as normal. The rest of the board is mainly bare fields with the odd bush, hedge or tree dotted around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys Théodred on the eastern side of the river Isen as close to the centre of the board as possible. The Good player then deploys the 12 Warriors of Rohan (see Participants) on the eastern side of the river and within 6" of Théodred. The Good player then deploys Grimbold and the Helmingas within 12" of the eastern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their entire force within 18" of the western board edge. All other models are kept aside until later.

Elfhelm -- *Upon receiving word of Théodred's predicament, Elfhelm leads his followers to his prince's
aid.*

During the End phase of each turn the Good player must roll a D6 and add the turn number to the result. If the result is 8 or more, Elfhelm and the remaining Good models will arrive at the end of the Good player's next Move phase from the eastern board edge via the rules for Reinforcements.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Théodred, Heir of Rohan with horse and shield; Elfhelm, Captain of Rohan with horse; Grimbold of Grimslade; 12 Riders of Rohan: 4 with throwing spears, 8 with no additional equipment; 24 Warriors of Rohan: 8 with shield, 8 with throwing spear and shield, 8 with bow (half of the Warriors of Rohan may be upgraded to be Helmingas); 3 Rohan Outriders on horse.

Evil: Vraskû; Thrydan Wolfsbane; 24 Uruk-hai Scouts: 8 with Uruk-hai bow, 8 with shield, 8 with no additional equipment; 9 Dunlending Warriors: 3 with shield, 3 with two-handed axe, 3 with bow; 6 Warg Riders: 2 with shield, 2 with Orc bow, 2 with throwing
spears.

SECOND BATTLEOF THE FORDS OF ISEN

*F*][*ollowing the first battle over the
Fords of Isen and the subsequent death of Théodred, command over the fords was given to Erkenbrand. However, it was Grimbold who was tasked with holding the fords against the forces of Isengard. Expecting the attack to come from the eastern side, Grimbold commanded Elfhelm and his riders to protect the river from the east whilst he would hold the ford itself.*

*However, the White Wizard is cunning and instead sent two smaller forces to divide the Rohirrim and surround those on the ford. A pack of Warg riders and Dunlending horsemen attacked the eastern side of the river, cutting off Elfhelm from those who defended the ford. With
Elfhelm otherwise engaged, an army of Dunlendings and fighting Uruk-hai attacked from the west, trapping Grimbold upon the fords
themselves.*

*Outnumbered and surrounded, Grimbold must fight alongside his men to hold the fords from falling to the might of Isengard. Yet even as
Grimbold stands defiant, Elfhelm leads his riders towards the ford, though he
must first cut through those that stand between him and his ally. If Elfhelm
can reach the fords in time, he may just be able to help Grimbold defend
the fords and prevent them from being
overrun.*

(6_Middle-earth_-_War_in_Rohan_media/media/image17.jpeg){width="3.326388888888889in"
height="3.2in"}

*OBJECTIVES*

The Rohirrim are trying to hold the ford against the might of Saruman's armies and prevent them from securing an easier route into Rohan.

The game lasts for 10 turns. Whichever side has more models on the ford at the end of the game is the
winner.

*SPECIAL RULES*

The River Isen -- *The river is deep and fast-flowing, crossing it at
any other point than the ford could prove to be
difficult.*

The river is counted as deep water for all
purposes.

Defend the Ford! -- *Grimbold and his men have been tasked with holding the ford and will fight hard to ensure it is
defended.*

Rohan models re-roll 1s To Wound in the Fight phase whilst they are on the ford.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the Fords of Isen. There should be a river that is 6" wide flowing down the centre of the board from north to south. In the middle of the river is the ford, a 6" wide area in the centre of the river that can be crossed as normal. The rest of the board is mainly bare fields with the odd bush, hedge or tree dotted around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys Grimbold in the centre of the board and then deploys their Infantry models within 6" of Grimbold. The Good player then deploys their Cavalry models within 6" of the centre of the eastern board edge. The Evil player deploys their Infantry models within 12" of the western side of the board. They then deploy their Cavalry models within 6" of either point shown on the map. These are the points 12" from the eastern board edge on the northern and southern board
edges.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Elfhelm, Captain of Rohan with horse; Grimbold of Grimslade; 12 Riders of Rohan: 4 with throwing spears, 8 with no additional equipment; 24 Warriors of Rohan: 8 with shield, 8 with throwing spear & shield, 8 with bow (half of the Warriors of Rohan may be upgraded to be Helmingas); 3 Rohan Outriders on horse.

Evil: Uruk-hai Captain with shield; Thrydan Wolfsbane with horse; Gorûlf Ironskin; 24 Uruk-hai
Warriors:

10 with pike, 10 with shield, 4 with
crossbow;

AMBUSH AT NIGHT

*H*][*aving caught the scent of the
Three Hunters tracking them, the Uruk-hai that have captured Merry
and*

*Pippin quicken their pace as they make haste to Isengard with their prize. After many hours running, the Uruk- hai and Orcs stop for a breather on the edges of Fangorn Forest, and begin to prepare a fire and gather their strength before continuing onwards.*

*However, the hunters are not the only ones that have been tracking
the Uruk-hai across the plains of Rohan; Éomer and his riders have followed the scouts of Isengard and plan to rid their lands of Saruman's
invaders. From the darkness, the riders of Rohan spring forth, catching the Orcs and Uruk-hai unawares as they bicker over whether they should eat their prisoners. The forces of Isengard now turn their attention to the men
that seek to slay them, and momentarily forget about their
prize.*

*It is in this moment that Merry and Pippin see the chance to escape.
If they can cut their bonds and crawl to the edge of the forest, they will be
safe from the Uruk-hai and the hooves of the Rohirrim's steeds. However,
they will need to be quick in their escape. For although the main body of
Orcs and Uruk-hai is otherwise occupied, Grishnákh is more concerned with
the taste of Hobbit, and is edging his way ever closer to his
prey.*

(6_Middle-earth_-_War_in_Rohan_media/media/image19.jpeg){width="6.873611111111111in"

height="3.1902777777777778in"}

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the plains by the edges of Fangorn Forest. The northern board edge is the boundary of the forest and so should be lined with trees. In the centre of the board is a campfire. The rest of the board is grassland and so is mainly
bare.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys Merry and Pippin as close to the centre of the board as possible, as shown on the map. The Evil player then deploys Grishnákh 3" away from the Hobbits towards the southern board edge. The Evil player then deploys the rest of their force anywhere within 6" of the campfire. The Good player then splits their force into two equal parts, each including one Hero. One half is deployed within 6" of the eastern board edge, the other within 6" of the western board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Rohirrim have caught the Uruk-hai off-guard and are intent on ridding their lands of these invaders. Yet even as the Rohirrim and Uruk-hai skirmish with each other, Merry and Pippin are trying to escape, making for the safety of
Fangorn.

The game lasts until one force has been reduced to 25% of its starting numbers and either the Hobbits have escaped the board via the northern board edge or been slain. The Good side wins if they have killed 75% or more of the Evil force. The Evil force wins if they kill 75% of the Good force. If either Merry or Pippin are slain, the best result the Good side can achieve is a
draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Surprise Attack -- *The Uruk-hai are caught unaware by the Rohirrim, who have ambushed them under the cover of
darkness.*

Evil models may not move during the first turn of the
game.

Merry and Pippin -- *The attack of the Rohirrim has provided the Hobbits with a chance to escape; the Uruk-hai are not paying attention
to two small Hobbits as they fight for their
lives.*

Merry and Pippin begin the game Prone and bound. They may only move by crawling, however, they may crawl 2" per turn rather than 1". They may not Charge enemy models and may not be charged by enemy models (the Uruk-hai have other things to worry about after all!). The Hobbits do not have a Control Zone in this game and may move through an enemy model's Control Zones without penalty. The Hobbits may also move through other models as if they were not there so long as they end their move with no part of their base overlapping another model. Other models may move through the Hobbits in the same way -- we assume they either walk over them or push them out of the way.

Their Bonds were Cut -- *The Hobbits are bound by rope, but should they cut their bonds, they will be able to move more
freely.*

At the end of each of Merry's and Pippin's move, they roll a D6 for each Hobbit. On a 6, they cut their bonds and are no longer Prone. They may move their full Move allowance from this point onwards.

Grishnákh -- *Unlike the other Orcs and Uruk-hai, Grishnákh is more focused on the Hobbits than the Rohirrim; something that earns him a spear in the back.*

Grishnákh follows the same rules for movement as the Hobbits, except that he moves 3" when crawling and cannot cut his bonds, as he is not bound. Grishnákh is the only model that may charge the Hobbits, and will Fight them in the Fight phase if he does so. If Grishnákh is fighting one of the Hobbits, both models will fight as normal even though they are Prone; ignoring any rules for fighting whilst Prone. Additionally, as he is wounded, Grishnákh starts the game with only a single point of Might and only has 1 Attack.

*H*][*aving escaped the clutches of
their Uruk-hai captors thanks to the timely assault by Éomer's
riders,*

*Merry and Pippin have made their way to the gnarled forest of Fangorn in search of safety. However, the wily Grishnákh has followed the Hobbits' tracks from the Uruk camp, and is following them into the depths of the forest with the hope of some easy kills and fresh meat.*

*Upon the realisation that they are being followed, the Hobbits pick up
their pace as they search for a place to hide within the branches of Fangorn. Checking every nook and tree trunk, Merry and Pippin are becoming more and more desperate to escape Grishnákh and the Orc is closing in on
them, determined not to let his prey slip through his fingers once
more.*

*Yet the forest of Fangorn is a mysterious place, and even the
sheltered Hobbits of the Shire have heard the rumours of trees coming alive
within the forests of Middle-earth. As the Hobbits continue to search for a
safe place, Grishnákh begins to close in upon them. Should he catch them
then the Hobbits will surely perish; unless the forest should provide them
with an unlikely ally, that is...*

height="1.6298611111111112in"}

*SET-UP*

For this mini-game you will require a deck of ordinary playing cards, Merry and Pippin, Grishnákh, Treebeard and a 2'x2' playing space. The board represents the forest of Fangorn and so should have plenty of trees on it. Shuffle the cards and place them in a pile face-down next to the board.

The Good player deploys Merry and Pippin in the centre of the board and then deploys Treebeard touching the centre of the eastern board edge. The Evil player then deploys Grishnákh touching the centre of the western board
edge.

*GAME TURN*

This mini-game is unusual in that it still uses some elements from the core rules as well as the extra rules presented here. All models will still use their profile as found in *Armies of The Lord of the
Rings*.

At the beginning of each turn, the Good player moves the Hobbits. To move a Hobbit the Good player flips over the top card from the deck, halves the number shown (rounding up), and moves the Hobbit up to that many inches -- picture cards will be covered later. Treebeard does not act yet; he is still asleep and will need to be woken up by the Hobbits before he may participate in this game.

The Evil player then moves Grishnákh in the same way as the Hobbits, with the exception that he may add 1" to the total number of inches moved when he flips a card
over.

Should the move of any model take them into base contact with an enemy, they will fight them as normal during the Fight
phase.

If at any point there are no cards left in the deck, shuffle the cards and start again.

*EXTRA RULES*

Picture cards -- When a picture card (King, Queen or Jack) is flipped over, the model that flipped it may perform a special action instead of moving. There is one set of special actions for the Hobbits and one for Grishnákh. If they decide not to use a special action, shuffle the card back into the deck and draw
again.

Injured -- As Grishnákh was wounded in the encounter with the Rohirrim, he starts the game with only a single Might
point.

*OBJECTIVE*

The game lasts until either Grishnákh has been slain, or both Hobbits have been slain. If, at the end of the game, Grishnákh has managed to kill both Hobbits, the Evil player wins. If none of the Hobbits have been slain, the Good player is the winner. Any other result is a draw.

*HOBBIT^™^ SPECIAL ACTIONS*]

-   
-   
-   

[Throw Stone: The Hobbit may throw a stone at Grishnákh using the Throw Stones (range 8", Strength 1) special rule.Climb
Treebeard: If the Hobbit is in base contact with Treebeard, they may climb him. Grishnákh may not attack the Hobbit whilst they are in the tree.Wake Treebeard: If the Hobbit has
climbed Treebeard, they may wake him up. If they do this, Treebeard is roused and may act as normal using the standard Strategy Battle Game
rules.*GRISHNÁKH'S SPECIAL ACTIONS*]

-   
-   

[Sprint: Grishnákh may move 6" this turn.Grab Hobbit: If Grishnákh is
in base contact with Treebeard, and a Hobbit has climbed the Ent, Grishnákh may pull them to the floor. Grishnákh may then fight the Hobbit in the following Fight phase.THE WHITE WIZARD

*R*][*ohan is weak and ready to fall;
Théoden's mind has been enslaved by Saruman, turning the king into but a puppet in his quest to conquer Rohan. Under the influence of Saruman, and his lackey Gríma Wormtongue, Théoden has banished Éomer and many of those loyal to him as he is driven further into madness and falls deeper under the control of Isengard.*

*Yet Théoden is not lost, and there are still some that seek to
relinquish his mind from Saruman's grasp. Having revealed himself as the White Wizard to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, Gandalf now rides with his companions to Edoras with the intent of freeing the king from Saruman's hold. Entering the Golden Hall of Meduseld under the guise of the Grey Wizard, Gandalf confronts Saruman and commands him to release Théoden from the spell; an act that is met with naught but disdain from Saruman.*

*Throwing aside his grey cloak, Gandalf finally reveals
himself*

*to be the White Wizard, or Saruman as he should have been. Now the
two Istari are locked in a duel of wits and magics over the mind of the king
of Rohan. Should Gandalf emerge victorious then Théoden shall be set free and Rohan restored. However, if Saruman retains power over the king then Rohan will surely fall to the might of
Isengard.*

*SET-UP*

For this mini-game you will require a deck of ordinary playing cards, Gandalf the White, Théoden, King of Rohan, and Saruman. Separate the cards into the four suits and then give the Diamonds to the Good player and the Spades to the Evil player. Next lay out the Hearts from Ace to Nine as shown above. The Clubs are not used in this game.

The Good player places Gandalf on the Ace of Hearts, then the Evil player places Saruman on the Nine of Hearts. Théoden is placed on the Five of Hearts.

*OBJECTIVE*

The first player to move Théoden onto the same card as their Wizard is the winner.

*GAME TURN*

At the beginning of each turn, players engage in a duel of wits. Both players simultaneously play one card from their hand face-down. Both players then reveal their cards and compare the types of card they have played. Each card will be one of three types of power: Offensive, Defensive, or Manipulation. Each of these types will beat one other type of power and lose to the other. Offensive powers beat Manipulation powers, Defensive Powers beat Offensive powers, and Manipulation powers beat Defensive powers.

After the cards have been revealed, compare the cards to find a winner. In the case of a draw, both cards are discarded and players start the turn again.

Whichever player wins the duel of wits may move Théoden one card closer to their Wizard and then implement the effects of their card. A list of card effects is given on the
right.

Both players then discard their cards, the turn then ends and the next turn begins. If at any point a player has no cards remaining, they pick up all the cards in their discard pile and start
again.

*EXTRA RULES*

Here are the effects and power type of each
card:

A (Offensive) -- No further effects.]

10. 

[(Defensive) -- No further effects.(Manipulation) -- No further
effects.(Offensive) -- Your opponent must show you their
hand.(Defensive) -- Take a card of your choice from your discard pile.(Manipulation) -- Your opponent must swap one card
in their hand for one in their discard pile.(Offensive) -- Your opponent
must discard a card of their choice from their hand.(Defensive) -- In the next turn, Théoden cannot
move closer to your opponent.(Manipulation) -- Your opponent must choose
their next card at random.(Offensive) -- Your opponent must discard a card from their hand at random.J (Defensive) -- For the next two turns, Théoden
cannot move closer to your opponent.

Q (Manipulation) -- Move Théoden one additional space closer to your Wizard.

K (Offensive) -- Pick a card; your opponent cannot play that card next turn.

The contents of the discard pile are common
knowledge;

you will need to use all of your cunning and wits in order to stay one step ahead of your opponent!

WARG ATTACK

*G*][*andalf's revelation that Saruman
is raising an army to destroy Rohan and its people forces Théoden to take drastic action. Though instead of facing the armies of Isengard head-on, as urged to by Aragorn, the king opts to leave Edoras and make for the sanctuary of Helm's Deep. Sending out orders for the city to be emptied, Théoden leads his people across Rohan and towards the mountain fortress.*

*Yet Saruman has anticipated the king's plans and, sensing that the Rohirrim will be more vulnerable on the road, has sent out his Warg Riders to intercept them. As the wolves of Isengard track their prey,
they happen upon an opportunity to catch the king's scouts unprepared. From atop a rocky outcrop, Saruman's Warg Riders pounce upon Gamling and Háma, catching them unawares and bowling Háma to the
floor.*

*The sudden attack heralds the arrival of Sharku and his Warg Riders, and forces the Rohirrim into a skirmish they are unprepared for.
Théoden must lead those around him against the riders of Isengard and drive
them off before they can reach his people. However, should the Wargs bring
down Rohan's leaders, then its people will be all the easier to pick off
later.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the hills and plains the Rohirrim travel across on their way to Helm's Deep and, as such, should have a few hills, rocky outcrops and hedges dotted
around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys Háma in the centre of the board, and then deploys Gamling within 3" of Háma in the eastern board half. The Evil player deploys the Orc Captain and two Warg Riders of their choice within 3" of Háma in the western board half. All other models are kept aside for later in the
game.

*OBJECTIVES*

Théoden commands his men to protect his people from the attack of the Warg Riders, who have been sent to kill as many of the Rohirrim and their leaders as they can. The game lasts for 12 turns. The Evil player wins if they can slay any three Good Hero models. The Good player wins if they can prevent this.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Surprise Attack -- *The Wargs have caught the Rohirrim unawares, pouncing upon them without warning.*

The Evil player automatically has Priority on the first turn of the game, and the Good player may not declare any Heroic Actions in the first turn of the game. Additionally, Evil Cavalry models gain a bonus of +1 to their Fight value in a turn in which they
Charge.

Háma -- *Having been knocked from his horse by the Warg Riders, Háma is floored and at the mercy of the
beasts.*

Háma starts the game Prone and with only a single point of Might.

To Battle! -- *Both sides are riding to battle with each other, making haste to the aid of their scouts and to engage the
enemy.*

At the end of each player's Move phase, they roll a D6 for each model not currently on the board. On a 3+ that model may enter the board. Good models enter from any point on the eastern board edge; Evil models enter from any point on the western board edge.

Gimli -- *Unable to ride into battle on his own, Gimli joins Legolas on
his steed as they head into the fray.*

Gimli starts the game as a passenger on Legolas'
horse.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Théoden, King of Rohan with horse; Aragorn -- Strider with horse; Legolas Greenleaf with horse; Gimli, son of Glóin; Gamling, Captain of Rohan with horse; Háma, Captain of Rohan; 6 Riders of Rohan: 2 with shield, 2 with throwing spear, 2 with no additional
equipment.

Evil: Sharku with Warg; Orc Captain on
Warg;

18 Warg Riders: 6 with shield, 6 with Orc bow, 6 with throwing spear.

RAISE THE LADDERS

*W*][*ithin the walls of Helm's Deep,
the people of Rohan prepare for the impending battle that is bearing down upon them. All manner of Rohirrim are being called to fight, many of whom are not natural fighters and some who have seen too many winters, or too few. Even as hope seems to be just out of reach, and victory seems impossible, a blast of an Elvish horn signals the arrival of an unlikely
ally.*

*From the forest of Lothlórien, Haldir leads an army of Galadhrim Elves
to Helm's Deep to fight alongside Théoden and his people, and to honour
the alliance that once stood between Men and Elves. Yet even their combined forces pale in comparison to the ten thousand fighting Uruk-hai that have marched from Isengard to kill all those in Helm's Deep and leave Rohan in ruins.*

*As the army of Isengard stands before the great fortress, the heavens
open, drenching those below and turning the ground beneath their feet into a thick quagmire of mud. As the rains pour down, the Uruk-hai begin their assault upon Helm's Deep, racing forward through the mud and towards the walls in order to raise their ladders and assail the
Deeping Wall. Those atop the battlements must attempt to stop the Uruk-hai from planting their ladders against Helm's Deep if they are to prevent their
foes from claiming the walls.*

height="3.323611111111111in"}

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the Deeping Wall and the lands in front of it. The area within 6" of the western board edge is the Deeping Wall itself, which should be the same height as the siege ladders. The rest of the board is barren and plain, and so will be easy for the Uruk-hai to navigate.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their force on top of the Deeping Wall. The Evil player then deploys their force anywhere within the eastern half of the board.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Ladders -- *Carried into battle by the Uruk-hai, these siege ladders
are used to get the forces of Isengard onto walls and into
battle.*

Siege Ladders are Heavy Objects that require four or more models to move them at full speed rather than two. They have no Defence characteristic and so cannot be targeted or damaged by shooting or in combat. If a Siege Ladder is moved within 3" of the Deeping Wall, it can be raised up against the walls. An Uruk-hai at the base of an upright ladder may move up it at full speed, and may even charge after climbing the ladder if able to do
so.

Berserkers -- *The Uruk-hai Berserkers are the toughest fighters in
the Uruk-hai army and will often be raised up atop the ladders so to get
them directly into the fight.*

When a Siege Ladder is raised, a single Uruk-hai Berserker within 1" of the ladder may be raised with it. Place the Berserker in base contact with the walls next to the point where the ladder was raised; it may then act as normal. If the Berserker cannot be placed on the walls then it is placed at the top of the ladder in combat with any models preventing it from being placed on the walls. The Berserker will count as defending an elevated position in this case.

Knocking Down Ladders -- *Those atop the Deeping Wall must try to knock down the ladders in order to prevent the Uruk-hai from
flooding the battlements.*

Ladders can be pushed down as described on page 122 of the main rules manual. Models that were on a ladder that is pushed down will suffer falling damage as
normal.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Uruk-hai must raise the ladders in order to get atop the walls and begin the assault on Helm's Deep, whilst those atop the walls must try to prevent the Uruk-hai from raising the ladders, and knocking down the ones that are placed
up.

The game lasts for 12 turns. The Good player wins if at the end of the 12^th^ turn there are two or fewer ladders up against the
walls.

The Evil player wins if at the end of the 12^th^ turn there are four
or more ladders up against the walls. Any other result is a
draw.

THE WALLS OF HELM'S DEEP

*S*][*aruman's armies have stormed the
Deeping Wall, pouring over the battlements and onto the walls themselves. The Men and Elves that stand atop the walls have been thrust into a desperate melee against the Uruk- hai forces. Together they are fighting to drive their foe backwards and against the battlements they have so easily passed, all whilst more Uruk-hai climb the great siege ladders and into battle.*

*Atop the walls, Aragorn leads the forces of Rohan against the foe,
Legolas and Gimli at his side as they endeavour to protect the walls from
falling. The Galadhrim are led by Haldir, and join their allies in the fight
against the forces of Isengard. Together the alliance of Men and Elves stand
defiant against the crushing tide of Uruk-hai, much akin to the alliance of
Elendil and Gil-galad that fought against the Dark Lord centuries
ago.*

*However, the combined forces of Men and Elves are vastly outnumbered and for each Uruk-hai warrior that is slain, another one takes its
place without hesitation. Only by killing enough of Saruman's fighting
Uruk-hai can the defenders of Helm's Deep hope to make a dent in the forces of Isengard, and earn themselves a brief respite where they can regroup
and continue their defence of Helm's Deep.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the battlements of Helm's Deep and the siege ladders propped up against the Deeping Wall. The area within 9" of the western board edge is the battlements, and so should be relatively clear. There are five siege ladders in this battle, spaced out as shown on the map. The area within 3" of the eastern board edge represents the fields outside Helm's Deep -- and it is rather a long way down!

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys all of their models within 6" of the western board edge. The Evil player then deploys their models within 1" of the Siege Ladders.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Uruk-hai have made it onto the battlements of Helm's Deep, and now the Men and Elves must fight to prevent the walls being overrun. If they can stem the tide of Uruk-hai, the battle may swing in their favour.

The game lasts for 12 turns. The Good side wins if at the end of 12 turns they have managed to kill 35 or more Evil models (it's important to keep track). The Evil side wins if they can prevent this. If Aragorn dies, the best result the Good side can achieve is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Numbers Beyond Count -- *Countless Uruk-hai have scaled the Deeping Wall, and more constantly climb the siege ladders to join the battle.*

Each time an Uruk-hai Warrior is slain, keep it to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase, any models kept aside in this manner may move onto the board from the siege ladders. Models that arrive in this way may Charge in the turn in which they arrive. Any models that cannot move onto the board in this way are kept aside for the next turn.

Battlements of Helm's Deep -- *The height of the walls of Helm's Deep means that any warrior unfortunate enough to fall from them will meet an untimely death.*

The eastern edge of the Deeping Wall is lined with battlements that can trap a model against them. Additionally, a model that is pushed from the battlements and onto the ground below is automatically slain -- it's a rather steep
fall!

PLANT THE CHARGES

*T*][*he siege of Helm's Deep is well
underway; Uruk- hai warriors have swarmed the battlements of
the*

*Deeping Wall and engaged the defenders in a close and desperate fight. The Men and Elves atop the walls must fight for their lives in an effort to force the Uruk-hai back and secure the Deeping Wall. However, it is not the Uruk- hai on the walls that pose the most immediate
threat.*

*Down below, the fighting Uruk-hai are carrying Saruman's demolition charges towards the walls, devices crafted by the Wizard to obliterate the walls of Helm's Deep in a flash of fire and stone. As the Uruk-hai carry the charges towards the culvert in the side of the walls, a select
few Uruk-hai Berserkers carry torches they intend to use to set off the
charges beneath the walls.*

*Those upon the walls must find a way to fell those Berserkers wielding
the torches in order to put them out. However, the natural resilience of
these frenzied killers makes them adept at shrugging off all but fatal blows.
If Legolas and his allies cannot put the Berserkers down then the Deeping Wall may yet be breached and the floodgates opened for the rest of the Uruk-hai forces to pour into the
fortress.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the Deeping Wall and the land in front of it. The area within 6" of the western board edge is the Deeping Wall itself, with the culvert in the centre of the wall. A selection of Siege Ladders are placed against the wall as shown. The rest of the board is barren and plain, and so will be easy for the Uruk- hai to navigate.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

*OBJECTIVES*

The Uruk-hai are attempting to breach the Deeping Wall using Saruman's demolition charges, whilst the defenders of Helm's Deep are trying to bring down those Uruk-hai that carry the torches. Should the Uruk-hai plant the charges within the culvert and set them off, the Deeping Wall will be
shattered.

The game lasts until one side has completed their objective. The Good side wins if they can kill all of the Uruk-hai Berserkers that are carrying torches. The Evil side wins if they can set off any Demolition Charge within 1" of the
culvert.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Numbers Beyond Count -- *Countless Uruk-hai have scaled the Deeping Wall, and more constantly climb the siege ladders to join the battle.*

Each time an Uruk-hai Warrior is slain (with the exception of the Uruk-hai Berserkers carrying torches), keep it to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase, any models kept aside in this manner may move onto the Deeping Wall from the siege ladders. Models that arrive in this way may Charge in the turn in which they arrive. Any models that cannot move onto the board in this way are kept aside for the next turn.

Detonating the Charges -- *The Uruk-hai Berserkers will go to any lengths to set off the charges, even killing themselves to ensure it will be done.*

The Good player deploys their models anywhere within 12" of the centre of the Deeping Wall. The Evil player then deploys all of their models, except the Demolition Teams, anywhere on the Deeping Wall but further than 1" away from any enemy model. The Demolition Teams are placed within 12" of the eastern board edge.

Evil models add 1 to the result when rolling on the Detonation table.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Aragorn -- Strider with armour; Legolas Greenleaf with armour; Gimli, son of Glóin; Haldir with heavy armour and Elf bow; 12 Warriors of Rohan: 4 with shield, 4 with throwing spear, 4 with bow; 12 Galadhrim Warriors: 4 with spear & shield, 4 with Elf bow, 4 with no additional equipment.

Evil: 4 Uruk-hai Captains with shield; 20 Uruk-hai Warriors: 10 with shield, 10 with pike; 8 Uruk-hai Berserkers; 3 Uruk- hai Demolition Teams.

THE DEEPING WALL IS BREACHED

*I*][*sengard has attacked the land of
Rohan, burning the Westfold and forcing the Rohirrim to flee to the safety of Helm's Deep. With the people of Théoden taking refuge within the fortress, Saruman sends his army of fighting Uruk-hai to breach its walls and slaughter the people inside. All of Isengard is emptied and an army over ten thousand strong marches to destroy the world of
Men.*

*As the siege of Helm's Deep begins, the forces of Isengard throw their
full force at the walls of the fortress to breach it. Battering rams, siege
ladders and ballistae are all utilised in the attempt to conquer its walls. Yet
it is the White Wizard's secret weapon that finally breaches the Deeping
Wall, a feat never before achieved since the fortress' founding. As the
collection of crude devices filled with black powder are placed within the culvert
of Helm's Deep, a lone Berserker sprints towards it, flaming brand in
hand, giving its life to bring about the destruction of the
wall.*

*Fire undoes stone in an explosion of rock and flame, sending great
chunks of Helm's Deep soaring into the air and many atop the walls are slain
by the devastation. It is through this gaping wound in the Deeping Wall
that the Uruk-hai forces pour into Helm's Deep, wading through the water
that has begun to collect in the breach created by their bombs. Can Aragorn
lead the alliance of Men and Elves against the onslaught of Isengard, or
will Helm's Deep fall for the first time in its
history?*

height="2.65in"}*LAYOUT*

This Scenario is played on a 2'x2' board. Along the eastern board
edge should be the Deeping Wall extending out 3" from the edge. This should have
some stairways coming down from it, and should also have a 4" section
missing from the centre (where the bomb went off). The area within 6" of the centre
of the eastern board edge is shallow water.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys the Galadhrim Warriors within 2" of the
western board edge and then deploys Haldir, Legolas and the Warriors of Rohan anywhere on the walls in the Prone position. Aragorn is deployed in the
centre of the board, also in the Prone position. Gimli is then deployed
anywhere within the shallow water.

The Evil player may then deploy up to 10 Uruk-hai Warriors, 2
Berserkers and a single Uruk-hai Captain within the shallow water, at least 1" from
Gimli. The rest of the Evil models will be available as the game goes
on.

The Prince of Mirkwood *-- It is at Helm's Deep that Legolas comes into his own, showcasing agility and skill that far surpasses that of most Elves.*

Once per game, if Legolas starts his Move phase in base contact with the top of a staircase, he may choose to use his Elven agility to slide down it atop an Uruk-hai shield. When he does this, Legolas may fire his Elven bow three times, as if it was the Shoot phase, as he moves down the staircase. Any model on the staircase automatically takes one Strength 3 hit and is knocked Prone. Additionally, one model within 3" of the bottom of the staircase suffers one Strength 4 hit as Legolas thrusts the Uruk-hai shield into their chest. Finally, Legolas is placed in base contact with the bottom of the staircase. He can move no further that turn and may not shoot in the following Shoot phase.

*OBJECTIVES*

The legions of Isengard are streaming into Helm's Deep, intent on
butchering all in their path. It is their sole purpose to cause as much death and
destruction as possible. Aragorn must lead the defenders of Helm's Deep in defence
of the fortress and fight off Saruman's armies.

The Scenario lasts for 10 turns, after which the side with the most
Victory Points is declared the winner.

There are three ways to score Victory Points in this
Scenario:]

1.  
2.  
3.  

[The Good player scores 1 Victory Point for each of their named Heroes still alive at the end of the game. The Evil player scores 1 Victory
Point for each of their named Heroes that have been slain.The Good player
scores 1 Victory Point if at the end of the game more than 14 Good models are left alive. The Evil player scores 1 Victory Point if at the end of the game fewer than 14 Good models are alive.Evil
models that are not within the shallow water are considered to be within the walls of Helm's Deep. The Evil player scores 2 Victory Points if at the end of the game there are more Evil models within the walls than Good models. The Good player scores 2 Victory Points if they can prevent this. Models that are on top of the walls do not count towards this total.*PARTICIPANTS*

Legion of the White Hand *-- Huge numbers of Uruk-hai are streaming
through the hole in the Deeping Wall, and more are constantly joining the
fight.*

At the end of each Evil Move phase, the Evil player rolls a D6 and adds
2. This is the number of models that the Evil player may move onto the board
from the hole in the Deeping Wall. These can be any models that haven't yet
entered the board, even models that have previously been slain earlier in the
battle. The Uruk-hai Captains may only enter the battlefield
once.

Explosion Aftermath *--The tremendous detonation that blew apart the
Deeping Wall has left those in command of the defence of Helm's Deep shaken and

[]{#bookmark35 .anchor}RETREAT TO THE
HORNBURG

*T*][*he destruction of the Deeping Wall
has led to a surge of Uruk-hai flooding forth through the gaping wound in the fortress, and now their sheer numbers are beginning to overwhelm the combined forces of Men and Elves. Seeing that the Deeping Wall is lost, Théoden orders those that still fight to retreat to the Hornburg so that they may concentrate on the defence of the keep and those left alive inside.*

*Hearing the king's orders, Aragorn relays Théoden's commands to those around him to fall back with as much haste as they can muster. However, there are now numerous fighting Uruk-hai that have spread across the fortress walls and stand between those upon the Deeping Wall and those fighting to defend the Hornburg.*

*The only way for Aragorn and his companions to reach Théoden, and the temporary safety of the Hornburg, is to fight their way through the onslaught of Uruk-hai that stand before them. Only by fighting hard against their enemy can the defenders of Helm's Deep hope to survive,
for the Uruk-hai fight with a renewed vigour in an effort to put an end to
the Kingdom of Rohan.*

The Deeping Wall has been breached and the Uruk-hai are flooding into the fortress. Théoden has called upon all those still alive to fall back; however, they must fight their way through the Uruk-hai in order to do so.

The game lasts until one side has completed their objective. The Good side wins if they can get 10 or more models off the northern board edge, including any two Hero models. The Evil player wins if they can kill enough models so that the Good player cannot achieve their objective. If Aragorn is slain the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

THE CAUSEWAY

*A*][*ragorn and his companions have
fought their way to the Hornburg and to the side of Théoden; however, they are not yet safe from the forces of Isengard. The Uruk- hai have reached the gates of Helm's Deep and are using a great battering ram to try to break through the gates and storm the fortress. Whilst Théoden and the Rohirrim attempt to barricade the remains of the gates, Aragorn and Gimli try to buy Théoden as much time as they
can.*

*Sneaking out of the fortress through a small side door, Aragorn and
Gimli find themselves in a position to leap onto the causeway and cause havoc within the Uruk-hai ranks. Deciding between them that engaging the Uruk-hai head-on is the best way to provide the Rohirrim the time they need, Aragorn tosses Gimli onto the causeway before leaping there
himself to join the fight.*

*Now Aragorn and Gimli fight alone in defence of the gates of Helm's Deep, driving back any Uruk-hai that tries to force their way through the gates. However, fighting here for too long will see them overrun
and cut down. They only need to hold out until Théoden has barricaded the gates before making their escape, but it will take every ounce of skill
and determination to last that long.*

*OBJECTIVES*

Aragorn and Gimli must keep the Uruk-hai distracted for long enough so that Théoden and the Rohirrim can barricade the gates. The game lasts for 12 turns. The Evil player wins if they can slay both Aragorn and Gimli, or have 10 models move off the board through the gates. The Good player wins if they can prevent this. If either Aragorn or Gimli is slain then the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Numbers Beyond Count -- *Countless Uruk-hai race up the causeway towards the gates of Helm's Deep, joining the
fight.*

Each time an Uruk-hai Warrior is slain, keep it to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase, any models kept aside in this manner may move onto the board from the eastern board edge.

The Gate -- *Helm's Deep has been battered and assaulted by the Uruk- hai, and the gates cannot withstand much more before being
splintered.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the causeway of Helm's
Deep.

The causeway is 6" wide and runs across the centre of the board from east to west; the rest of the board is a steep drop above the rocks below. On the western side of the causeway are the gates of Helm's Deep.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys Aragorn and Gimli within 2" of the gates. The Evil player then deploys their force anywhere on the causeway at least 3" away from any Good
model.

The Gate has a Defence of 8 and only a single Wound remaining.

[]{#bookmark41 .anchor}FALL BACK TO THE
KEEP

*T*][*he hordes of Isengard have blown
apart the Deeping Wall, revealing a gaping wound in the side of the fortress which the Uruk-hai forces use to flood through and onto the walls of Helm's Deep. Those that defended the walls have been forced to fall back to the Hornburg, though the overwhelming numbers of the Isengard forces have felled many Elves and Men as they fought to hold them
back.*

*With his forces heavily outnumbered, Théoden orders all those that
survive to fall back to the keep to make one final stand against the onslaught
of metal and flesh that is upon them. However, the Uruk-hai have managed to divide the king's forces and now many must fight their way through
to the safety of the keep. If Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli cannot carve a
way through the Uruk-hai, they will be felled upon the walls of Helm's
Deep.*

*Out on the causeway, Aragorn and Gimli have held back the Uruk-hai for as long as they can, buying Théoden enough time to barricade the gates. However, even once barricaded against their foes, the gates did
not hold back the tide of Uruk-hai for long, and soon they flood through
the gates and into the fortress. Saruman's plan to end the kingdom of Rohan seems to be working...*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the inside of the Hornburg, and as such will have a few walls and battlements as shown on the map. In the centre of the western board edge are the doors to the keep. Surrounding them are the stairs that lead up to them; these are the area within 3" of the western board edge and within 3" of the doors to the keep. The stairs down to the Hornburg are only 6" wide, the rest is surrounded by walls (see
map).

*OBJECTIVES*

The defenders of Helm's Deep are trying to fall back to the temporary safety of the keep; however, a swarm of Uruk-hai now stands between Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and their allies. They must fight their way through the Uruk-hai if they are to survive.

The game lasts until either the Good player achieves their objective, or the Evil player kills enough Good Hero models to make it impossible for the Good player to win. The Good player wins if they can get any three Good Hero models to escape the board via the doors to the keep. The Evil player wins if they can prevent this.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Numbers Beyond Count -- *Countless Uruk-hai race have invaded Helm's Deep, and more continuously join the
fray.*

Each time an Uruk-hai Warrior is slain, keep it to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase, any models kept aside in this manner may move onto the board from the centre of the southern board edge.

We Stand Together -- *Théoden is trying to buy his allies as much time as he can to reach the safety of the keep and will not abandon them to die.*

Théoden and Gamling may not escape the board until any one of Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli has escaped the board
first.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys Théoden, Gamling and half of the Warriors of Rohan on the stairs to the keep. They then deploy their remaining models within 6" of the north-east corner of the board. The Evil player then deploys their models within the southern half of the board, but at least 6" away from any part of the stairs to the keep.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Aragorn -- Strider with armour; Gimli, son of Glóin; Legolas Greenleaf; Théoden, King of Rohan with heavy armour and shield; Gamling, Captain of
Rohan;

24 Warriors of Rohan: 8 with shield, 8 with throwing spear, 8 with bow.

Evil: 3 Uruk-hai Captains with shield; 30 Uruk-hai Warriors: 15 with shield, 15 with pike.

RIDE OUT

*T*][*he forces of Isengard have swarmed
through Helm's Deep; their path of devastation has left naught but destruction and death in their wake, and those that still stand against them have been forced back into the keep. Within the walls of the throne room, Théoden begins to realise that the battle is almost lost. How can those that remain hope to fend off such reckless hate in order to
survive?*

*Yet all is not lost. As dawn begins to break and the morning sun
begins to filter through the windows of the keep, Aragorn remembers Gandalf's
words to him and reminds the king that his men have died valiantly defending
the fortress. Together Aragorn and Théoden hatch a plan to ride out against
the forces of Saruman in one final attempt to force the Uruk-hai backwards. They are aware that failure is not an option; it will be death or
glory.*

*Théoden and his allies prepare themselves, mounting their steeds and waiting to charge. As soon as the doors to the keep are splintered,
Gimli sounds the Horn of the Hammerhand and Théoden leads those that remain in a charge against the Uruk-hai. With little thought for their
own safety, the remaining defenders of Helm's Deep continue their charge
all the way through the fortress, and onto the causeway. Though they are
few, if they can slay enough of the Uruk-hai then they may be able to rout
them and win the day.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the edge of the causeway and the land outside the fortress of Helm's Deep, as such the board should be relatively clear. The causeway should extend out 6" from the centre of the north-west corner of the board. The western board edge represents the walls of Helm's
Deep.

*OBJECTIVES*

This is the final gambit of Théoden and his followers; they will either kill enough Uruk-hai to rout the enemy, or die in the attempt.

The game lasts until one player's force is wiped out, at which point the other player is the winner.

*SPECIAL RULES*

For Death or Glory -- *Knowing that this may be their final stand, the defenders of Helm's Deep fight with renewed strength in order to
try to claim victory.*

Friendly Cavalry models gain a bonus of +1 Strength on a turn in which they charged.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Aragorn -- Strider with armour and
horse;

Legolas Greenleaf with armour and horse; Théoden, King of Rohan with armoured horse, heavy armour and
shield;

Gamling, Captain of Rohan, with horse and Royal Standard of Rohan; 4 Rohan Royal Guard with horse and throwing spears

Evil: 3 Uruk-hai Captains with shield; 20 Uruk-hai Warriors: 10 with shield, 10 with pike.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys all of their models on the
causeway.

The Evil player then deploys all of their models within 6" of the centre of the board.

[]{#bookmark45 .anchor}ÉOMER'S RETURN

*H*][*aving remembered Gandalf's final
words before departing Edoras, Aragorn and Théoden have rallied their allies and charged forth from the gates of Helm's Deep. As they continue to fight through ranks of Uruk-hai, dawn begins to break over the valley, and Aragorn and Théoden look to the east where their eyes are met by a welcome sight.*

*Atop the hills that lead down into the valley, Gandalf can be seen
sat atop Shadowfax, and he has not come alone. Éomer also stands beside the White Wizard, who calls his Riders of Rohan to come forth. From the top of the hills Éomer gives a cry of 'To The King!' and leads the charge of
the Rohirrim to the side of their liege.*

*As the riders charge forth, and the Uruk-hai rank up to meet their
foes head-on, the sun begins to crest over the hills behind them, flooding
into the valley below and blinding the Uruk-hai who now stand between Éomer and his king. Yet the Uruk-hai are numerous, and Éomer, Gandalf and their riders will have to cut a path through them if they are to save
the last surviving defenders of Helm's Deep from being
slain.*

height="6.493055555555555in"}

*OBJECTIVES*

Éomer has rallied his followers and now rides to the aid of his king. However, a vast horde of Uruk-hai stands between him and Théoden, and so Éomer and his riders will need to kill enough to cause them to rout.

The game lasts until one side has completed their objective. The Good player wins if they can kill 75% of the Evil force. The Evil player wins if they can slay any two of the Good Hero models before this can happen. If both players complete their objective in the same turn, the game is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

To The King! -- *With a rousing cry Éomer leads the charge of the Rohirrim as they hurtle towards their foes in defence of their
king.*

Friendly Rohan Cavalry models within 12" of Éomer gain +1 Strength on a turn in which they
Charge.

Look to the Sun -- *The arrival of the White Wizard and the Rohirrim brings with it the morning sun, blinding their foes as they charge towards them.*

Once per battle, so long as Gandalf is alive and in your force, you can declare you are using this ability at the start of any friendly Move phase. Until the end of the turn, enemy models that are Engaged with, or supporting a model Engaged with, any friendly Cavalry models that made a Charge that turn, suffer a penalty of -1 to their Duel rolls.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Éomer, Marshall of the Riddermark on
horse;

Erkenbrand, Captain of Rohan on horse; Gandalf the White on Shadowfax; 24 Riders of Rohan: 8 with throwing spears, 16 with no additional equipment.

Evil: 3 Uruk-hai Captains with shield; 30 Uruk-hai Warriors: 15 with shield, 15 with pike.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the southern hill that forms the valley Helm's Deep resides in, as well as some of the lands outside the fortress. The area within 3" of the eastern and western board edges, in the southern half of the board, are the impassible rock faces that create the path down to the fortress. The northern half of the board is the land outside Helm's Deep and should be relatively barren.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys Éomer 3" away from the centre of the southern board edge, and then deploys the rest of their models within 3" of the southern board edge. The Evil player deploys their forces within 12" of the northern board
edge.

THE BATTLEOF HELM'S DEEP

*S*][*aruman's invasion of the Kingdom
of Rohan has been ruthless and his forces have brought death and ruin to its people. Many of Rohan's villages have been torched and their people slain, and bands of Dunlendings and Uruk-hai scour the Westfold intent on bringing yet more of Rohan to its knees. With the constant war that has engulfed his realm, Théoden has made the decision to make for the refuge of Helm's Deep in an attempt to protect his
people.*

*It is Théoden's belief that Saruman will not be able to touch them
within Helm's Deep, however, the White Wizard has amassed an army of more than ten thousand fighting Uruk-hai warriors; an army big enough to lay siege
to almost any fortress in Middle-earth. Upon the news that such an army
marches to Helm's Deep to bring death to the people of Rohan, Théoden begins to prepare those within the walls for the war that has been thrust upon
them.*

*Every able-bodied man of Rohan able to wield a sword is called upon
to fight, though many have seen too many winters, or too few, to fend off the armies of Isengard. Fear is rife within the ranks of the Rohirrim, with many believing they will not last through the night. As panic
begins to set in, the sound of Elven horns can be heard signaling the arrival
of some unlikely allies that have come to honour the alliance that once
stood many years ago between Men and Elves.*

*A host of Galadhrim Elves, led by Haldir of Lórien, has journeyed to Helm's Deep to aid the Rohirrim against the approaching mass of Saruman's armies. Together, Men and Elves stand side-by- side once more, this time upon the Deeping Wall of Helm's Deep, as ten thousand Uruk-hai bear down upon them. The Battle of Helm's Deep will prove to be the greatest battle in the history of the Kingdom of Rohan.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the fortress of Helm's Deep and the lands outside it. The Hornburg is situated in the 2'x2' area in the north-west corner, with the causeway extending out onto the battlefield and the Deeping Wall running from the Hornburg to the southern board edge about 24" away from the western board edge (see map). In the centre of the Deeping Wall should be a culvert, and the area of Deeping Wall surrounding it (about 6" in total) should be removable. The rest of the board should be clear to allow plenty of space for the Uruk-hai to make their way to the fortress walls.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys the Defenders of the Deeping Wall anywhere on the Deeping Wall. They then deploy the Defenders of the Hornburg anywhere in the Hornburg. The Relief Force is kept aside for later in the game. The Evil player then deploys their force anywhere within 12" of the eastern board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Battle of Helm's Deep is a huge battle fought across the entire fortress; as such this Scenario has five objectives for both sides to fight over. As this Scenario will take a long time, we suggest you gather your friends and decide amongst you how long to play for (we recommend at least five hours -- possibly a whole weekend!) and whichever team has achieved the most objectives by the time the game ends is declared the winner!]

at the end of the game the Deeping Wall has been destroyed, the Evil player claims this objective. If the Deeping Wall remains intact then the Good player claims this objective.The Hornburg -- Whichever player has the
most models within the Hornburg at the end of the game claims this objective.The Heroes of Helm's Deep -- There are eight Good Hero models within the fortress of Helm's Deep: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Théoden, Gamling, Aldor, Haleth and Haldir. If at the end of the game there are more of these Hero models alive than dead, the Good player claims this objective. If more of these Hero models have been slain, the Evil player claims this objective.The Causeway -- Whichever player has the most models upon the causeway at the end of the game claims this objective.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Ride Out -- *With hope fading fast, Théoden decides that the only way to achieve victory is to ride out from the fortress and take the
fight to the Uruk-hai.*

At the start of the 8^th^ turn, and any turn that follows, any Good Hero model within 6" of the gates of the Hornburg that could be mounted on a horse may immediately gain a
mount.

The Deeping Wall -- *Unbeknownst to Théoden, Helm's Deep has a weakness which Saruman intends to exploit with the use of siege bombs.*

If a siege bomb is successfully detonated whilst within 3" of the culvert of Helm's Deep, the removable section of the Deeping Wall is removed from play. Any model on that part of the wall immediately suffers a Strength 9 hit and will then suffer falling damage as described in the main rules
manual.

Look to my Coming -- *Gandalf's words have echoed in Aragorn's mind, and now he leads a band of Rohirrim to aid those fighting at Helm's Deep.*

At the end of the Good player's 10^th^ Move phase, they may move the Relief Force onto the board from the southern board edge on the eastern half of the board, via the rules for Reinforcements, however, models may Charge on the turn they
arrive.

Ladders -- *Carried into battle by the Uruk-hai, these siege ladders
are used to get the forces of Isengard onto the walls and into
battle.*

Siege Ladders are Heavy Objects that require four or more models to move them at full speed rather than two. They have no Defence characteristic and so cannot be targeted or damaged by shooting or in combat. If a Siege Ladder is moved within 3" of the Deeping Wall, it can be raised up against the walls. An Uruk-hai at the base of an upright ladder may move up it at full speed, and may even charge after climbing the ladder if
able.

Knocking Down Ladders -- *Those atop the Deeping Wall must try to knock down the ladders in order to prevent the Uruk-hai from
flooding the battlements.*

Ladders can be pushed down as described on page 122 of the main rules manual. Models that were on a ladder that is pushed down will suffer falling damage as
normal.

EDORAS

*A*][*s Théoden and his allies journeyed
to the fortress*

*of Helm's Deep, Gandalf rode out from Edoras in search of those still loyal to their king. In his search across the Riddermark, Gandalf manages to track down Éomer and his men and brings them news of the danger Théoden and his people now face as an army from Isengard marches upon them.*

*Yet as Gandalf and Éomer make plans to ride for Helm's Deep, Gandalf fears that bands of Orcs and Wild Men of Dunland may seek to pillage and overrun the now empty city of Edoras. In order to protect the
capital from this potential threat, Gandalf sends Elfhelm and his Éored to the capital to ensure it stays standing, and is ready for the king's return following the Battle of Helm's Deep.*

*Having ridden with haste to Edoras and reaching its gates, Elfhelm becomes aware that the Wizard's fears have been realised. In the
distance, a rabble of Wild Men and Warg Riders can be seen racing towards the city. It falls to Elfhelm and his men to fight to ensure that Edoras
does not fall, and that those who would see it burn are fought back and the city is made safe.*

*OBJECTIVES*

Elfhelm has been sent to Edoras by Gandalf to protect it from any who may seek to pillage it whilst Théoden and the rest of his people are at Helm's Deep. The army of Dunlendings and Orcs has come to raze Edoras to the ground and claim what they can for themselves. The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to 25% or less of its starting numbers. The Good player wins if the Evil force has been reduced to 25%, whilst the Evil player wins if the Good force has been reduced to 25%. If both forces are reduced to 25% in the same turn, the game is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Defend Edoras -- *The Rohirrim have been tasked with protecting Edoras, and will fight to rid their home of any invaders that make it into the city.*

Good models may re-roll To Wound rolls of a 1 against any Evil models that are fully within the walls of
Edoras.

LAST MARCH OF THE ENTS

*F*][*rom within the depths of Fangorn
Forest, the Ents have begun the slow march to war with Isengard, the treason of Saruman finally brought to their attention by the arrival of Merry and Pippin. Much of the forest has been destroyed, ripped up and used to fuel the furnaces of Isengard as it strained to produce the vast numbers of weapons required by Saruman's army. Gone are the times when the White Wizard would wander the paths of the forest, for now his mind is only focused on darkness and metal.*

*Upon the discovery that many of his friends have been cut down,
Treebeard summons the Ents of Fangorn and starts the long march towards the Tower of Orthanc. With much of Isengard all but emptied, the Ents find themselves facing the Orcs that run the forges, who are armed with
flaming arrows and ropes which they use to try to bring down the shepherds of the forests.*

*Can the Ents release the river and wash away the filth of Saruman, or
are they marching to their doom and the extinction of their
race?*

height="3.1902777777777778in"}

*LAYOUT*

This Scenario is played on a 4'x4' board. Within the centre of the board stands the Tower of Orthanc. The board should be dotted with a variety of scaffolding and pits to represent the industrial heart of Isengard. In the centre of the western board edge should be the dam holding back the River Isen.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys all of their models within 6" of the eastern board edge. The Evil player may deploy their models anywhere within the western board half, or atop any piece of scaffolding on the board.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Ents can only wash the filth of Saruman from Isengard by breaking the dam and releasing the River Isen. Should they fail to accomplish their task, the legions of the White Hand will become a force to be reckoned with in
Middle-earth.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Flaming Arrows *-- The Ents of Fangorn are highly susceptible to fire, a fact that the Orcs of Isengard will use to their advantage by setting
their arrows alight before unleashing them upon their
foe.*

Any Orc that hits an Ent with a shooting attack on the roll of a 6, and then subsequently Wounds their target, will cause 2 Wounds rather than 1. These Wounds are multiplied before Fate rolls are taken.

Bring them down! *-- By utilising ropes and their weight of numbers, the Orcs can topple the Ents, allowing for their comrades to set upon
them from ground level.*

If an Ent loses a Fight, all Orc models involved in the Fight may choose to try to fell the Ent rather than Strike it as normal. Instead of making Strikes, each Orc in base contact with the Ent rolls a D6. If any 6s are scored, then the Ent has been successfully brought down and is knocked Prone.

Release the River *-- Only by breaking the dam can the Ents flood the factories of Isengard, inflicting defeat upon the White
Wizard.*

The dam has a Defence of 10 and 5 Wounds, and can only be harmed in combat.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Treebeard with Merry & Pippin;
Quickbeam;

Beechbone; 3 Ents.

Evil: 4 Orc Captains with shield; 48 Orcs Warriors: 16 with shield, 16 with spear, 8 with two-handed weapon, 8 with Orc bow.

The Good player is the winner if they can destroy the dam. The Evil player wins if they can slay all of the Good models before this is accomplished.

THE URUK-HAI" RETREAT

*T*][*he arrival of Gandalf and the
Riders of Rohan that he brought with him has given victory to Rohan, routing the Isengard forces in the process. Knowing that the battle is now lost, the Uruk-hai have the choice to turn and flee or to be cut down where they stand. Whilst some fight to the last, many are forced to turn tail and flee towards
Isengard.*

*With as much haste as they can muster, the Uruk-hai begin to run. However, instead of making their way back to Isengard from the path they marched some days ago, the remaining Uruk-hai are instead forced northwards by the Rohirrim and into the dense undergrowth of the
forest, where they are not welcome guests.*

*The treachery of Isengard has not been forgotten, and the trees that
were cut down to fuel the fires deep within the pits of Isengard are
remembered by the Ents that remain within the forest. As the Uruk-hai race between trees and branches, the sound of creaking bark and snapping twigs
alerts them to the danger they are really in. Fangorn has sought vengeance
upon Isengard, and it will deal it swiftly to those Uruk-hai who have fled into their lands.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the edges of Fangorn Forest. As such, it should be densely populated with trees across the entire board. There should be enough room for the Ents to move between the trees but other than that, the more trees you have on the board the better!

*OBJECTIVES*

With the Battle of Helm's Deep lost, the Uruk-hai are trying to flee back to Isengard to regroup. However, to do so they must go through Fangorn where the Ents are waiting for them. The game lasts for 10 turns. The Evil player wins if eight or more Uruk-hai models can escape the board via the eastern board edge. The Good player wins if they can prevent this from happening.

Restless Trees -- *Fangorn Forest has gone to war with Isengard, and the trees will lash out at the Uruk-hai as they attempt to
flee.*

During the End phase of each turn, each Uruk-hai model within 2" of a tree suffers a Strength 4 hit. As there are a lot of trees in this Scenario, this will be happening quite a
lot!

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: 3 Ents.

Evil: 2 Uruk-hai Captains with shield; 20 Uruk-hai Warriors: 10 with shield, 10 with pike.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their models within 6" of the western board edge. The Evil player does not deploy any models; instead they will automatically enter the board from the western board edge at the end of the Evil player's first Move phase via the rules for Reinforcements.

PATHS OF THE DRÚADAN

*A*][*s Théoden leads the Rohirrim to
war, his scouts bring news that the path to Minas Tirith has been blocked by an army of Orcs, preventing them from reaching the Pelennor unscathed. Théoden is faced with a choice; either to face this threat head-on yet risk arriving at the battle too late, or to venture into the depths of the Drúadan Forest and hope to pass by unseen.*

*Fortune, however, smiles upon Théoden as he is approached by
Ghân-buri- Ghân, the tribal leader of the Woses that dwell in the forest. These
strange Men are thick-set and smaller than most, yet have lived within the
boughs of the forest for many years, learning all of its secrets and hidden
paths. Ghân-buri-Ghân swiftly offers Théoden help in passing through the
forest unhindered, aid which the king of Rohan readily
accepts.*

*Within the forest of Drúadan, the newly-formed alliance of Rohirrim and Woses happen upon a rabble of Orcs hacking their way through the thick undergrowth in search of their enemies. Once more, Ghân-buri-Ghân offers Théoden his aid, this time in the slaying of the Orcs that now
block their path to war -- for the Woses harbour a deep and burning hatred
for Orcs and all their kind, and so the opportunity to slay more of these
foul creatures greatly excites them.*

*LAYOUT*

This Scenario is played on a 4'x4' board. The entire board should be covered with trees and various other wooded
areas.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Evil player deploys their force anywhere between 12" and 24" of the southern board edge. The Good player then deploys all of their models anywhere within 12" of the northern board
edge.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Wild Men Know all Paths *-- The Woses know all of the secrets of the forest and often use hidden pathways to journey through the trees
-- pathways that they shared with the riders of
Théoden.*

All Good models gain the Fleetfoot and Woodland Creature special rules whilst they remain
mounted.

Ambush! *-- The Orcs are completely unaware of the Rohirrim in the woods until they are already on top of
them.*

Evil models may not move at all on the first turn of the
game.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Théoden, King of Rohan; Éomer, Marshal of the Riddermark; Éowyn, Shield Maiden of Rohan; Gamling, Captain of Rohan; 12 Riders of Rohan (including 4 with throwing spear); Ghân-buri-Ghân; 9
Woses.

All Rohan models must be mounted and may have armour and shields if they are able to.

Evil: 3 Morannon Orc Captains with
shield;

36 Morannon Orcs: 9 with shield, 9 with spear, 9 with spear & shield, 9 with no additional
wargear.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Rohirrim must reach the Pelennor before the battle is lost, time is of the essence and they cannot risk being delayed in the
forest.
