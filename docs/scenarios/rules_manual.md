With your armies chosen, you're ready to begin your Matched Play game. Here you will find a selection of twelve Scenarios, designed to give both players an even chance of winning. You can either agree with your opponent which Scenario you would like to play, or you can randomise by rolling on the charts below. First roll a D6 to determine which of the two tables to roll on next. Then roll a second D6 to determine which Scenario you will play. It is usually a good idea for one player to roll the first dice then the other player roll the second — that way which Scenario you play is equally both players' fault!

D6 ROLL OF 1-3 D6 ROLL OF 4-6

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| D6 RESULT | D6 RESULT |

| 1 Domination | 1 Hold Ground |

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| 5 Reconnoitre | 5 Fog of War |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
 Each Scenario contains all of the information you need to get set up and start playing. This information is broken down into the following categories: The Armies, Layout, Starting Positions, Initial Priority, Objectives and Special Rules (if there are any for that Scenario).

[]{#bookmark305 .anchor}GOOD VS**o**GOO**E**D**l**AND EVIL VS EVIL
 Whilst the game is designed to be played as Good versus Evil, there will be occasions in which you may find both players playing as either Good or Evil. In these situations you will need to decide which of you will be the 'Good' player and which of you will be the 'Evil' player for the purpose of roll-offs.

[]{#bookmark311 .anchor}SCENARIO 1 — DOMINATION

*This battlefield will provide a distinct tactical advantage for whoever
holds it for many years to come. Victory can be achieved by forcing the
enemy back and securing the key points on the battlefield. Failure will not be
permitted!*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

Players fight to control five objectives scattered across the battlefield.

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136]. Then, place
five Objective markers on the battlefield; one is automatically placed in the centre of the board. To place the other objectives, both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score places one objective anywhere on the battlefield at least 12" away from the existing objective and 6" away from any board edge. Their opponent then places a third objective at least 12" away from existing objectives and at least 6" away from any board edge. The players then alternate placing the remaining two objectives, according to the restriction noted earlier.

STARTING POSITIONS

Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force to deploy within 24" of their board edge. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their warband.

When this has been done, the opposing player chooses one of their warbands and deploys it within 24" of their board edge, as described above. Players then alternate until all of their warbands have been placed.

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models or below, at which point the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 2 Victory Points for each Objective marker that has at least one of your models, and no enemy models, within 3".

- You score 1 Victory Point for each Objective marker that has both friendly and enemy models, but more friendly than enemy models, within 3".

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader (Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count) or if you kill the enemy leader.

- You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game.

[]{#bookmark313 .anchor}SCENARIO 2 — TO THE DEATH!

*Once again, fate has pitted the forces of Good and Evil against each
other, and no matter the cost, the enemy must be slain. No quarter shall
be asked and none shall be given. Only the Valar know who will win the day!*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

Victory goes to the force which can crush the foe and slay the enemy leader.

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136].

STARTING POSITIONS

Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force to deploy within 12" of their board edge. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their warband.

When this has been done, the opposing player chooses one of their warbands and deploys it within 12" of their board edge, as described above. Players then alternate until all warbands have been placed.

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models or below, at which point the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader (Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count). If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 3 Victory Points.

- You score 3 Victory Points if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score

5 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point if you have at least one banner remaining at the end of the game. If you have at least one banner remaining and your opponent has none remaining, then you instead score 2 Victory Points.

- You score 2 Victory Points if the enemy force is reduced to 25% of its starting models at the end of the game.

[]{#bookmark315 .anchor}SCENARIO 3 — HOLD GROUND

*In the swirl of battle it becomes apparent that a certain, usually
insignificant, area of the battlefield has become vital to the victory
of both sides. Both forces surge towards this new tactical advantage, desperate to control
it.*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

Control the centre of the battlefield, no matter the cost.

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136]. Once the
battlefield has been set up, an Objective marker is placed in the centre of the battlefield. Players must also agree which direction is north — this is important for determining where and when Reinforcements arrive from.

STARTING POSITIONS

At the battle's start, the forces are yet to arrive — models are not deployed at the start of the game, but will enter as the game continues (see Special Rules later).

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

Once one force has been Broken, the game might suddenly end. At the end of each turn, after this condition has been met, roll a D6. On a 1-2, the game ends — otherwise, the battle continues for another turn.

At the end of the game, the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

![](../media/rules_manual/image233.jpeg)

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 3 Victory Points if you have more models within 6" of the objective than your opponent. If you have twice as many models within 6" of the objective than your opponent, then you instead score 5 Victory Points. If you have three times as many models within 6" of the objective than your opponent, or you are the only player to have models within 6" of the objective, then you instead score 7 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader (Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count). If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score

3 Victory Points.

SPECIAL RULES

Maelstrom of Battle: At the end of your Move phase, roll a D6 for each of your warbands not on the battlefield and consult the chart below (the warband's captain can use Might to alter the roll either up or down). Models can't charge in the turn that they arrive but otherwise act normally. Roll for each warband separately, deploy the models in the warband, if the D6 allows, then roll for the next. Warbands yet to arrive count as being on the battlefield for the purposes of determining if your force is Broken.

D6 RESULT

1. The warband does not arrive.

2. Your opponent chooses a point on either the north or south board edges at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

3. Your opponent chooses a point on either the east or west board edges at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

4. You choose a point on either the north or south board edges at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

5. You choose a point on either the east or west board edges at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

6. You choose a point on any board edge at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

![](../media/rules_manual/image234.jpeg)

[]{#bookmark318 .anchor}SCENARIO 4 — LORDS OF BATTLE

*After weeks of skirmishes and close encounters with the opposing side,
it comes down to one final battle to determine which faction will emerge
victorious. The more enemies a side can kill, the more it will spur them on to
victory.*

[]{#bookmark321 .anchor}SCENARIO 5 — RECONNOITRE

*Scouts have been sent out by both forces in order to gather vital
information from behind enemy lines. Each force is attempting to sneak
past the enemy whilst simultaneously preventing the enemy from doing the same.*

![](../media/rules_manual/image237.jpeg)![](../media/rules_manual/image238.jpeg)

SCENARIO OUTLINE

Ensure more of your models escape the battlefield than your opponent.

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136].

STARTING POSITIONS

At the battle's start, the forces are yet to arrive — models are not deployed at the start of the game. Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest result chooses one of the long table edges to be their board edge — the opposing player has the opposite board edge as their board edge (see Special Rules later).

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models, or below, at which point the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

Models that have escaped the board count as being on the board for the purpose of determining if a force is Broken.
 *Player As board edge\^d 'arbands enter from here* */ Player B's board edge Warbands enter from here*

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 3 Victory Points if more of your models have escaped the battlefield via your opponent's board edge than vice versa. If at least two of your models and twice as many models than your opponent have escaped the board, then you instead score 5 Victory Points. If at least three of your models, and three times as many models than your opponent have escaped the board, then you instead score 7 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader — Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count. If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score

3 Victory Points.

SPECIAL RULES

Reinforcements: At the end of your Move phase, roll a D6 for each of your warbands that are not on the battlefield and consult the chart below (the warband's captain can use Might to alter the roll). Models enter the board via the rules for Reinforcements ([see page 33)].

Roll for each warband separately, deploy the models in the warband, then roll for the next. Warbands yet to arrive count as being on the battlefield for determining if your force is Broken. Warbands that have still not arrived by the start of the fourth turn will automatically arrive on turn 4.

D6 RESULT

1-3 The warband does not arrive, but receives +1 to this dice roll next turn.

4-6 The controlling player chooses a point on their board edge at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.
 *Designer's Note:* Special rules that allow for models to arrive on from any table edge (such as the Goblin Mercenary Captain's Mercenary Ambush) must choose the controlling player's table edge for this Scenario.

![](../media/rules_manual/image239.jpeg)

[]{#bookmark324 .anchor}SCENARIO 6 --A CLASH BY MOONLIGHT

*Two opposing forces have happened upon each other in the dead of night,
thrusting them into an impromptu battle. The darkness makes for an
unusual fight, providing both forces with protection from arrows and greater
options for stealth.*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

A battle to the death in the dark of night!

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136].

STARTING POSITIONS

Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force to deploy within 12" of their board edge. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their warband.

When this has been done, the opposing player chooses one of their warbands and deploys it within 12" of their board edge as described above. Players then alternate until all warbands have been placed.

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models or below, at which point the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader. Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count. If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.

- You score 3 Victory Points if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score

5 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point if you have at least one Hero remaining at the end of the game. If you have at least one Hero left alive, and have killed more Hero models that your opponent, you instead score 3 Victory Points. If you have at least one Hero remaining, and your opponent has none remaining, then you instead score 5 Victory Points.

SPECIAL RULES

The Dark of Night: Due to the reduced visibility, models cannot be targeted by shooting, Magical Powers or special abilities over 12" away. However, as it is much harder to avoid a shot in the dark, all shooting attacks gain a bonus of +1 when rolling To Wound. Siege Engine models may still target enemy models more than 12" away — however in this situation they will only ever hit on the roll of a 6.

![](../media/rules_manual/image240.jpeg)

[]{#bookmark326 .anchor}SCENARIO 7 — SEIZE THE PRIZE

*Within Middle-earth, an ancient and mysterious artefact has awoken. Its
power has drawn two opposing armies to claim it, hoping to use its
secrets for their own ends. Both forces will stop at nothing to possess it.*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

Recover a precious item and carry it through the enemy force to victory.

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136]. Place a 25mm
marker in the centre of the board to represent the artefact.

STARTING POSITIONS

Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force to deploy within 12" of their board edge. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their warband.

When this has been done, the opposing player chooses one of their warbands and deploys it within 12" of their board edge as described above. Players then alternate until all warbands have been placed.

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

The game lasts until either a model carrying the artefact carries it off the board via their opponent's board edge, or both forces have been reduced to a quarter (25%) of their starting number of models, or below, at which point the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 3 Victory Points if one of your models is carrying the artefact within your own board half. If one of your models is carrying the artefact within your opponent's board half, then you instead score 5 Victory Points. If one of your models is carrying the artefact and manages to move off the board via your opponent's board edge, then you instead score 7 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader. Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count. If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score

3 Victory Points.

SPECIAL RULES

The Artefact: The artefact must be dug out of the soil before it can be carried anywhere. An Infantry model who is in base contact with the Artefact marker at the end of its Move may attempt to free it.

Roll a D6. On a 4+, the artefact has been freed, the artefact is treated as a Light Object ([see page 109)]. Might cannot
be used to influence this roll. Only one model from each side may attempt to pick up the artefact each turn.

![](../media/rules_manual/image241.jpeg)![](../media/rules_manual/image242.jpeg)

*Following a rousing speech for the ages, the leaders of both forces
head into battle to inspire their followers to great deeds. It is upon
the field of battle that the two armies' generals must fight to outshine each other,
in an attempt to spur on their troops, break the spirit of their enemies
and ultimately win the day.*

[]{#bookmark330 .anchor}SCENARIO 9 — CAPTURE AND CONTROL

*By holding key strategic points, both armies believe they can control
the field of battle and use these tactically important locations to
force their enemy into defeat. Whoever controls the battlefield will have gained an important
foothold for the many battles yet to come.*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

Control areas of the battlefield and deny them to your foe.

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136]. Then, place
five Objective markers on the battlefield; one is automatically placed in the centre of the board. One objective is placed exactly halfway between the centre of the board and the centre of the northern table edge. The other three objectives are deployed in the same way in relation to the east, south and west board edges respectively (see map).

STARTING POSITIONS

Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force and roll a D6.

Players then take it in turns (starting with the player who rolled highest) to select a warband in their force and roll a D6.

On a 1-3, all models in that warband must be deployed in the deployment zone and within 12" of the centre line of the board. On a 4-6, the models can be deployed anywhere in the deployment zone. Models may not be deployed within 1" of an enemy model. Regardless of the dice roll, models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their warband.

When this has been done, the opposing player chooses one of their warbands and rolls to place it as described above. Players alternate until all warbands have been placed.

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

Once one force has been Broken, the game might suddenly end. At the end of each turn after this condition has been met, roll a D6. On a 1-2, the game ends — otherwise, the battle continues for another turn.

At the end of the game, the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 2 Victory Points for each Objective marker that is under your control at the end of the game.

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader or kill the enemy leader. Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count.

- You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game.

SPECIAL RULES

Controlling Objectives: At the start of the game, all of the objectives are considered to be neutral and do not belong to either side. If, during the End phase of any turn, one or more of your models are in base contact with an objective, then that objective comes under your control. If, during the End phase both sides have models in base contact with an objective, then that objective returns to being a neutral objective.

[]{#bookmark333 .anchor}SCENARIO 10 — HEIRLOOM OF AGES PAST

*Buried somewhere upon the field of battle is a long-forgotten heirloom
of ages past. Having narrowed down its location, the two armies now
fight for possession of this relic. However, the powers that linger upon this
mysterious object are easily capable of corrupting those who hold it for
too long.*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

A precious relic lies upon the battlefield. They who hold it will win the day!

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136]. Then, place
six Objective markers on the battlefield. To place the objectives, both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score places one objective anywhere on the battlefield at least 6" away from any board edge. Their opponent then places an objective at least 12" away from the existing objectives and 6" away from any board edge. The players then alternate placing the remaining objectives, according to the restriction noted earlier.

STARTING POSITIONS

At the battle's start, the forces are yet to arrive — models are not deployed at the start of the game, but will enter as the game continues (see Special Rules later).

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models, or below, at which point, the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 6 Victory Points if your force is in possession of the relic at the end of the game. If at the end of the game you are not in possession of the relic but have more models within 3" of the relic than your opponent, then you instead score 3 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader. Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count. If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score

2 Victory Points.

If you have at least one banner remaining and your opponent has none remaining, then you instead score 2 Victory Points.

SPECIAL RULES

Uncovering the Relic: Only one of the objectives is actually the relic that both sides seek. The first time each turn an unengaged Infantry model ends its movement in base contact with an objective, they may search it in an attempt to uncover the relic. When this happens roll a D6. On a 6, the relic has been discovered and the model that discovered it takes possession of it (Might cannot be used to influence this roll). If the roll is a 1-5 then the relic is not there, remove the objective from play. If the first five objectives to be searched do not reveal the relic, the last one will automatically be the relic, there is no need to roll for it.

Relic of Power: The relic is treated as a Light Object, however the dark powers that lie upon it may seep into the mind of its holder. Unwilling to give it up, models carrying the relic may not drop it or pass it to another model. Additionally, at the start of each turn, before Priority is rolled, roll a D6. On a 1, the model is Transfixed as on page 98. Might may not be used to modify this roll.

Maelstrom of Battle: At the end of your Move phase, roll a D6 for each of your warbands not on the battlefield and consult the chart opposite (the warband's captain can use Might to alter the roll either up or down). Models can't Charge in the turn that they arrive but otherwise act normally. Roll for each warband separately, deploy the models in the warband, then roll for the next. Warbands yet to arrive count as being on the battlefield for the purposes of determining if your force is Broken.

D6 RESULT

1. The warband does not arrive.

2. Your opponent chooses a point on either the north or south board edges at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

3. Your opponent chooses a point on either the east or west board edges at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

4. You choose a point on either the north or south board edges at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

5. You choose a point on either the east or west board edges at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

6. You choose a point on any board edge at least 6" from a corner — all models in the warband move onto the battlefield from this point.

*Amidst the maelstrom of the battle that rages, the two forces clash in
an endless swirl of shields and swords. Battle plans constantly change
and the two generals become locked in a battle of wits, both trying to work out
their adversary's aims.*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

Outwit your opponent by concealing your true objective.

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136].

STARTING POSITIONS

Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force to deploy within 12" of their board edge. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their warband.

When this has been done, the opposing player chooses one of their warbands and deploys it within 12" of their board edge as described above. Players then alternate until all warbands have been placed.

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

Once one force has been Broken, the game might suddenly end. At the end of each turn after this condition has been met, roll a D6. On a 1-2, the game ends — otherwise, the battle continues for another turn.

At the end of the game, the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

![](../media/rules_manual/image252.jpeg)

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- At the start of the game secretly note down one of your own Hero models — this may not be your leader unless you only have one Hero. You score 1 Victory Point if the nominated Hero is still alive at the end of the game. If the nominated Hero is still alive and has suffered no Wounds, you instead score 3 Victory Points.

- At the start of the game secretly note down one of your opponent's Hero models — this may not be your opponent's leader unless they only have one Hero. You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the nominated Hero. Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count. If you kill the nominated Hero, you instead score 3 Victory Points.

- At the start of the game secretly note down a single terrain piece in your opponent's half of the board. You score 1 Victory Point if at the end of the game you have more models than your opponent completely within your selected terrain piece. If your opponent has no models completely within your selected terrain piece and you have at least one, you instead score 3 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score

3 Victory Points.
 *Designer's Notes*: *In this Scenario you should not reveal any of your objectives to your opponent, even if you successfully complete them during the game. Part of the skill of this Scenario is trying to work out what your opponent is attempting to accomplish, whilst simultaneously trying to mislead them into thinking that you are trying to accomplish something that you aren't.*

*Both armies desire the land before them for its strategic position
within* Middle-earth*. Setting up encampments, both forces seek to
outlast their opponents and claim the land for their own. However, with neither side
willing to yield its stake, war befalls these two opposing sides. It is
now time to decide the dominant force by seizing the other's camp and scattering its
defenders.*

SCENARIO OUTLINE

Oust the enemy from their camp, while keeping yours secure.

THE ARMIES

Players choose their forces, as described on [page 130],
to an equal points value before the game.

LAYOUT

Set up terrain as described on [page 136].

STARTING POSITIONS

Both players roll a D6. The player who scored the highest may choose one of the four table corners as their camp. They then deploy their army (including any Siege Engines) entirely within 12" of their chosen table corner. Any models that cannot be deployed within 12" of the chosen corner will move onto the board via the controlling player's corner at the end of their first Move phase. Their opponent then sets up their army entirely within 12" of the table corner diagonally opposite.

INITIAL PRIORITY

Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models, or below, at which point the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.

Victory Points are scored for the following:

- You score 3 Victory Points if your force managed to capture your opponent's camp. If your force managed to capture your opponent's camp and your camp is not captured, you instead score 6 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader. Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count. If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 3 Victory Points.

- You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score 3 Victory Points.

SPECIAL RULES

The Campsite: The campsites are the deployment areas of the two armies. A campsite is captured if during the End phase of any turn you have more models entirely within your opponent's campsite than they do. Should your models subsequently leave a captured campsite, it will no longer count as being captured. In order to keep an opponent's campsite captured, you will need to keep your models within your opponent's campsite.

Models that are within their own campsite will defend it at all costs. Any model that is within its own campsite at the start of a turn will automatically pass any Courage tests it is required to make for the remainder of that turn.

[]{#bookmark392 .anchor}ADAM TROKE'S MINAS TIRITH

Inspired by the heroic defence of Minas Tirith as depicted in *The Lord of the Rings*: *The Return of the King™*, Adam has built this army up over the course of a few months. Originally, his army started life as a joint effort with his friend Sam so they could attend a Doubles tournament weekend, but since then it has taken on a life of its own, with Adam constantly adding more to it. Adam's fledgling army has since grown into the mighty 1,000 point force you see below.

Due to Denethor's The Rule of Gondor is Mine, and No Others! special rule, Adam must choose Denethor to be the leader of his army. Because Denethor is a Hero of Valour, Adam has been able to pack a total of 15 Warrior models into the warband. This provides the Steward of Gondor with an inner circle of Guards of the Fountain Court and Citadel Guard for his protection, and seeing as they all have the Bodyguard special rule, makes them very useful indeed.

THE ARMY OF THE DEAD Adam isn't content with leaving his Army of Minas Tirith as it is — he's begun adding allies in already, painting the King of the Dead and a full warband of Warriors of the Dead too. His plan is to add these, along with Aragorn, to the army as Historical Allies in the very near future.

Gandalf the White is Adam's next Hero, and he has included Peregrin Took, Guard of the Citadel within his warband, along with a slew of Warriors of Minas Tirith to represent those who fought alongside the Wizard on the White City's ramparts. Adding Gandalf provides Adam's force with access to some Magical Powers such as Immobilise and Blinding Light, which can be very useful in a tight spot.

A Captain of Minas Tirith leads a third warband, of Warriors of Minas Tirith, giving the force some much-needed numbers and a solid front line that can benefit from the Shieldwall special rule, while Faramir, Captain of Gondor leads a small unit of Knights to act as a cavalry reserve. The Trebuchet not only provides devastating long-range power, but conjures the image of the army gathered atop the walls of Minas Tirith.

Dan has been collecting his Isengard army for a few years, and recently gathered together an impressive army to march to war at 2017's *The Hobbit*™ Throne of Skulls tournament. However, with the new rules and changes to building an army, Dan has been eagerly painting up even more Uruk-hai so that he can put together a brand new force consisting of a nice mixture of Uruk- hai Warriors and Uruk-hai Scouts.

Dan has chosen Saruman to lead his armies due to the magical support that the *White Wizard* can provide. As Saruman is a Hero of Legend, Dan has given him a full warband of 18 fighting Uruk-hai with an equal mix of shields, pikes and crossbows, providing Saruman with plenty of protection against those more combat orientated heroes that pose a serious threat to the former lord of the Istari.

Dan also wanted to make as much use of the Isengard Army Bonus as he could, so he has included Lurtz and 15 Uruk-hai Scouts into his force. As the Army Bonus gives Lurtz and his Uruk-hai Scouts the Woodland Creature special rule, Dan's army has a quick-moving and hard-hitting warband that can cause plenty of problems for enemies that try to hide in the woods themselves.

As the deployment for Siege Engines has now significantly changed, Dan leapt at the chance to get an Isengard Siege Ballista into his force, having always wanted to use one with his Uruk- hai. Being able to deploy a Siege Engine at the back of the board regardless of what a player rolls is a real asset, and one that meant that Dan included one in his force.

As you can see, Dan's force is rather impressive, containing a good amount of *Uruk-hai* Warriors and Scouts as well as a few Uruk-hai Berserkers for some extra punch. The inclusion of the two Uruk-hai Captains means that Dan has plenty of access to Heroic March to get his army straight into the fight, whilst Lurtz possesses the ability to Heroic Strike so that he can take on even the mightiest of foes.

[]{#bookmark398 .anchor}JAY CLARE'S DEFENDERS OF EREBOR

Jay wanted to build his army around the epic scenes from *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*™, where Men, Elves and Dwarves fight alongside each other against the teeming hordes of Azog's Legion in defence of Erebor and Dale. Jay has combined warbands from the Iron Hills, Halls of Thranduil and Survivors of Lake-town in order to build an impressive 1,000 point army that can accurately recreate the scenes from the films.

Even though Jay has selected three warbands from three different army lists: the Iron Hills, Halls of Thranduil and Survivors of Lake-town, all three of the armies in his force are all Historical Allies with each other. This means that Jay's force will still get to benefit from all three of its Army Bonuses, something that Jay was very keen to make sure of. The combination of Iron Hills Dwarves, Mirkwood Elves and Lake-town Militia makes this force one to be reckoned with.

To get the best feel of the scenes from the film, Jay has chosen to have the three main leaders of the armies in his force: Bard, Dain and Thranduil. All of these Heroes are Heroes of Legend, which means that they could all be selected as the force's leader. All three Heroes would excel in this role but Jay has chosen to make Bard the leader — although this may be more to do with the fact that Bard is his favourite character than anything else!

As Bard, Dain and Thranduil are all Heroes of Legend, they can all lead warbands of 18 Warriors, and Jay has made the most of this by packing each Hero's warband with the maximum number of models to bring his force up to a rather large 57-model total — perfect for fighting large battles against a horde of Gundabad Orcs and their monstrous allies.

SURVIVORS OF LAKE-TOWN

Jay already has quite a large collection of Lake-town models, both from the Army of Lake-town and the Survivors of Lake-town, and he is planning on adding even more to them — next up will be yet more Lake-town Militia as well as Bain, Sigrid & Tilda.

[]{#bookmark401 .anchor}DAVID WHITAKER'S AZOG'S HUNTERS

David has been involved with the Strategy Battle Game for a number of years, and has built up quite an impressive collection of models for his vast array of armies from all areas of Middle-earth. However, possibly his favourite army is his collection of Azog's Hunters, which he has been constantly adding to over time — so naturally he was eager to see how the new rules affected his choice of army building. His 1,000 point army is:

When choosing his leader, David had the choice between Bolg and *Bill the Troll,* as they are both Heroes of Valour. As the majority of his force is from the Azog's Hunters list, David has opted to select Bolg to lead his forces into battle. He has then packed his warband with as many Hunter Orcs as he can, making the most of Bolg's 15-model warband limit, to ensure that Bolg has a suitable amount of protection from enemy warbands at all times.

The rest of David's Azog's Hunters contingent is made up of Hunter Orcs on Fell Wargs and a few unridden Fell Wargs to increase David's numbers and provide a few quick models that can capture objectives and be a nuisance to his opponents. To lead his mounted Hunter Orcs, David has chosen Fimbul the Hunter on Fell Warg and a Hunter Orc Captain on Fell Warg. Fimbul brings an additional three Might points to David's army, and has the option to Heroic Strike. David has converted his Hunter Orc Captain to show the wounds it suffered leading Azog's forces into previous battles. Eagle-eyed readers will notice it is the same Captain that David used as the leader of his Battle Company, clearly the Orc has won the favour of Azog and been promoted! The addition of the Hunter Orc Captain also adds the option to Heroic March; very important for certain Scenarios.

David finalised his army by adding the *Three Trolls*, three powerful Monster models, into his force. As Azog's Hunters and the Trolls are only Allies of Convenience, both parts of David's army will lose their Army Bonuses. However, as David is rather fond of the Trolls from the films, he is quite happy to lose the Army Bonuses for the sake of fitting some of his favourite characters into his list.

**WHAT'S NEXT?**

So, you've read through this rules manual and begun to get your head
around how the game works. By now you are probably thinking 'where do I go from here?'.

Well, the first place to look to are the two army books that cover all
of the characters, warriors and creatures from *The Lord of the Rings*™ and *The Hobbit*™. From there, there are loads of other resources and
places to get extra Middle-earth content from.

![](../media/rules_manual/image417.jpeg)

![](../media/rules_manual/image418.jpeg)

THE ARMIES OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS

This manual covers all of the profiles for the characters from *The Lord
of the Rings*™ trilogy, from the noble warriors of Gondor that bravely fought
against the forces of Sauron, to the fighting Uruk-hai that were bred by Saruman
in the pits of Isengard to put an end to the race of Men.

The Armies of *The Lord of the Rings*™ is a 240-page hardback tome that
contains 27 different army lists, representing factions from both the films and
the books; as well as 11 different Narrative Play Scenarios that faithfully
recreate some of the most iconic scenes from both page and screen.

The Armies of *The Lord of the Rings*™ is available now to help you
begin, or continue, your journey into Middle-earth.

![](../media/rules_manual/image419.png)

![](../media/rules_manual/image420.jpeg)

THE ARMIES OF THE HOBBIT

The Armies of *The Hobbit*™ covers all of the profiles for the
characters depicted within *The Hobbit*™ films and books, from the ragged and homeless
militia from Lake-town, to the fearsome and fully-armed legions that march upon *The
Lonely Mountain* from Gundabad.

This hardback manual contains 20 different army lists from *The
Hobbit*™ trilogy as well as from the pages of the books. There are also 11
Narrative Play Scenarios that allow you to play through your favourite scenes, enabling
you to recreate them with your own models.

[]{#bookmark406 .anchor}The Armies of *The Hobbit*™ will be available in
the coming months. In the meantime, until it is released, you can use the profiles found in the
Heroes and Villains of *Middle-earth* download and *The Hobbit: Motion Picture
Trilogy™ There and Back Again*. There is also a free PDF download available on the
Games Workshop website that will provide you with the army lists, and what
they contain, as well as the Heroic Tiers and Heroic Abilities of all the
heroes found within *The Hobbit*™ to tide you over until The Armies of *The Hobbit*™
is released.

***WEBSTORES***

When looking to expand your collection of Middle-earth models, the Games
Workshop and Forge World webstores contain a huge variety from every faction in the game; making them the
perfect place to expand your fledgling collection into an army worthy of Mordor (other races are, of course,
available)!
