## CROSSING OF THE RIVER CARNEN

*OBJECTIVES*

Brand has come to the banks of the River Carnen to negotiate with the Easterlings; however, Sauron's army will not be dissuaded and are intent on crossing the river and marching to
war.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Evil player wins if at least 33% of their models have reached the western side of the river by the end of the game. The Good player wins if they can prevent this. Additionally, if Brand is slain then the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

The River -- *The Carnen is fast flowing and dangerous to
cross.*

The River counts as Deep Water.

Onwards to Erebor! -- *The Easterlings are relentlessly marching to
the Lonely Mountain and will cut down any who stand in their
path.*

Easterling models may re-roll failed To Wound rolls in the Fight phase.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the River Carnen and the surrounding area. There should be a 6" wide river running through the centre of the board from north to south. In the centre of the board there should be a ford that is at least 6" wide that crosses the river, allowing
for an easy place for the forces to cross. The rest of the board should be relatively barren and so should have the odd tree, bush and hedge dotted around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the western board edge. The Evil player then deploys their force within 12" of the eastern board edge.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Brand, King of Dale; Captain of Dale with shield; 20 Warriors of Dale: 6 with shield, 8 with spear and shield, 6 with Esgaroth bow.

Evil: Rutabi, General of the Dragon Legion; Easterling Captain with armoured horse, sword and shield; Easterling War Priest; 20 Easterling Warriors:

8 with shield, 4 with pike and shield, 8 with
bow;

5 Easterling Kataphrakts.

## THE HOSTS CLASH

*SPECIAL RULES*

To War! -- *With the Battle of Dale having begun, both sides will
fight until the bitter end to achieve
victory.*

Models from both sides, apart from those armed with a bow, Esgaroth bow or crossbow, must Charge if able to do
so.

A Bond Forged in War -- *The friendship forged between the two kings, Dáin and Brand, is one that has stood for many years. Should either be in danger, the other will risk all to save
them.*

If either Dáin or Brand would be Trapped in the Fight phase, then the other may declare a Heroic Combat without spending Might. If successful, they must join their Trapped ally's fight if possible. If this is not possible, they must move as close as possible to their Trapped ally.

Heroes of the Easterlings -- *The Easterlings are a proud warrior culture whose leaders relish the chance to fight; and the assault on
Erebor provides them with a platform to claim the glory they
seek.*

*LAYOUT*

Easterling Hero models may re-roll a D6 in a Duel
roll.

The board represents the lands between Erebor and Dale. The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the northern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 12" of the southern board edge.

*PARTICIPANTS*

## PLAINS OF EREBOR

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the lands between Erebor and
Dale.

The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around. There should be three Objective
Markers

on the board. The first is placed in the centre of the board. One is placed halfway between the centre of the board and the north-east corner of the board, whilst the final one is placed halfway between the centre of the board and the north-west corner of the
board.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their models anywhere within the northern half of the board. The Evil player then places their models anywhere within the southern half of the board, but not within 1" of an enemy model.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Easterlings have begun to force the alliance of Men and Dwarves back and now look to claim key areas of the battlefield. The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good player wins if they control at least two objectives at the end of the 10^th^ turn. The Evil player wins if they control at least two objectives at the end of the 10^th ^turn. Any other result is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Controlling Objectives -- *To control one of the key positions of the battlefield, one force must dominate that
area.*

An army is considered to be controlling an Objective Marker if there are more friendly models within 3" of the marker than enemy models. If both sides have the same number of models within 3" then neither side controls that Objective
Marker.

A Bond Forged in War -- *The friendship forged between the two kings, Dáin and Brand, is one that has stood for many years. Should either be in danger, the other will risk all to save
them.*

If either Dáin or Brand would be Trapped at the start of the Fight phase, then the other may declare a Heroic Combat without spending Might. If successful, they must join their Trapped ally's fight if possible. If this is not possible, they must move as close as possible to their Trapped ally.

Heroes of the Easterlings -- *The Easterlings are a proud warrior culture whose leaders relish the chance to fight; and the assault on
Erebor provides them with a platform to claim the glory they
seek.*

## DEATH OF BRAND

*OBJECTIVES*

Brand has been separated from his allies, and Dáin must now fight his way to Brand's side before the Easterling forces overwhelm him. The game lasts for 10 turns, or until Brand is slain. The Good player wins if Brand is alive at the end of the game. The Evil player wins immediately if Brand is
slain.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Brand's Last Stand -- *Surrounded and outnumbered, Brand 4 knows that this could well be his end -- though he will not go down without a fight.*

In this Scenario, Brand increases his Fight value to
6.

Allies in War -- *Brand and Dáin have been firm allies for many
years, and Dáin will stop at nothing to defend his friend on the
battlefield.*

Dáin may declare a Heroic Combat each turn
without

T spending Might.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the lands between Erebor and
Dale.

The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around. In the centre of the board should be a slightly raised area for Brand to defend.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys Brand in the centre of the board, and then deploys the Knights of Dale within 3" of
him.

The Evil player deploys their force within 12" of the centre of the board, but not within 6" of an enemy model. The Good player then deploys the rest of their models within 12" of the centre of the northern board edge.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Brand, King of Dale; Dáin Ironfoot,
King

Under the Mountain; 6 Knights of Dale; 12 Iron Hills Dwarves with spear.

Evil: Rutabi, General of the Dragon Legion; Brórgîr the Conjurer; 20 Easterling Warriors: 8 with shield, 4 with shield and pike, 8 with bow; 2 Rhûnish War
Drakes.

## DÁIN'S LAST STAND

*OBJECTIVES*

Incensed by the death of his friend, Dáin will defend Brand's body until either the battle ends or he himself falls. The game lasts for 12 turns or until Dáin is slain. The Good player wins if Dáin is alive at the end of 12 turns. The Evil player wins immediately if Dáin is slain.

*SPECIAL RULES*

The Wrath of Ironfoot -- *Dáin is beside himself with grief at the
loss of his ally and will unleash his fury upon those that slew
him.*

Dáin Ironfoot must re-roll all failed To Wound
rolls.

Victory within Reach -- *The death of King Brand signals that victory is close at hand for the Easterlings, a fact that encourages them to
keep piling the pressure onto those who
remain.*

Easterling models within 3" of the centre of the board count as being in range of a banner.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the lands between Erebor and
Dale.

The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around. In the centre of the board should be a slightly raised area for Dáin to defend.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Dáin Ironfoot, King Under the
Mountain;

12 Iron Hills Dwarves with spear.

Evil: Rutabi, General of the Dragon Legion; Brórgîr the Conjurer; 20 Easterling Warriors: 8 with shield, 4 with shield and pike, 8 with bow; 2 Rhûnish War
Drakes.

*STARTING POSITIONS*


The Good player deploys Dáin in the centre of the board, and then deploys their remaining models within 3" of him. The Evil player then deploys their models anywhere on the board at least 6" from any Good model.

## RETREAT TO EREBOR

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the lands between Erebor and
Dale.

The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around. The northern board edge is the Lonely Mountain, in the centre of which are the gates of Erebor, which are 6" wide in
total.

*OBJECTIVES*

With the armies of Erebor and Dale severely outnumbered, they must retreat to Erebor if they are to survive. However, the Easterling forces are trying to cut them off from the safety of the Lonely Mountain.

The game lasts until either the Good player completes their objective, or the Evil player kills enough Good models to make it impossible for the Good player to win. The Good player wins if 10 or more Good models move off the board via the gates of Erebor. The Evil player wins if they can prevent this. Additionally, if either Bard or Thorin are slain, the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Fall Back! -- *Bard and Thorin are aware that the battle has gone ill and have ordered a hasty retreat.*

Bard and Thorin may declare Heroic March in this Scenario, even though they would not normally be able to do
so.

Additionally, whenever Bard or Thorin declare a Heroic March they do not need to spend Might points to do so -- it is
free.

The Heirs to the Kingdoms *-- When their fathers perished upon the field of battle, the new heirs to Dale and Erebor continued to honour
the alliance that had stood between their people, protecting their allies as
their fathers had done.*

## SIEGE OF EREBOR

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the battlements of Erebor and the siege ladders propped up against the walls. The area within 9" of the northern board edge is the battlements, and so should be relatively clear. There are five siege ladders in this battle, spaced out as shown on the map. The area within 3" of the southern board edge is the plains outside Erebor -- and is rather a long way
down!

*SPECIAL RULES*

Numbers beyond Count -- *The Easterlings constantly scale the walls, with more climbing the siege ladders to join the
battle.*

Each time an Easterling Warrior is slain, keep it to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase, any models kept aside in this manner may move onto the board from the siege ladders. Models that arrive in this way may Charge in the turn in which they arrive. Any models that cannot move onto the board in this way are kept aside for the next turn.

Battlements of Erebor -- *The height of the walls of Erebor means that any warrior unfortunate enough to fall from them will meet an untimely death.*

The southern edge of the walls of Erebor is lined with battlements that can trap a model against them. Additionally, a model that is pushed from the battlements and onto the ground below is automatically slain -- it's a rather steep
fall!


*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Bard II, Prince of Dale; Thorin III
Stonehelm;

10 Warriors of Dale: 3 with shield, 4 with spear & shield, 3 with Esgaroth bow; 6 Knights of Dale; 12 Iron Hills Dwarves: 6 with spear, 3 with mattock, 3 with
crossbow.

Evil: Rutabi, General of the Dragon Legion; Easterling Captain with shield; Easterling Dragon
Knight;

21 Easterling Warriors: 8 with shield, 4 with shield and pike, 8 with bow, 1 with
banner;

12 Black Dragons: 6 with shield, 6 with pike and
shield;

6 Dragon Cult Acolytes.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys all of their models within 6" of the northern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their models within 1" of the Siege Ladders.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Easterlings have made it onto the battlements of Erebor, and now the Men and Dwarves must fight to prevent the walls being overrun. If they can stem the tide of Easterlings, they may be able to buy themselves some more time.

The game lasts for 12 turns. The Good side wins if at the end of 12 turns they have managed to kill 35 or more Evil models (it's important to keep track). The Evil side wins if they can prevent this. If either Bard or Thorin die, the best result the Good side
can

## THE TIDE TURNS

*SPECIAL RULES*

The Heirs to the Kingdoms -- *When their fathers perished upon the field of battle, the new kings of Dale and Erebor continued to honour
the alliance that had stood between their people, protecting their allies as
their fathers had done.*

If either Thorin III Stonehelm or Bard II would be Trapped in the Fight phase, the other may declare a Heroic Combat without spending Might. If successful, they must join their Trapped ally's fight if possible. If this is not possible, they must move as close as possible to their Trapped ally.

Broken Morale -- *News of the Dark Lord's defeat and the destruction of the black tower of Barad-dûr has sapped the resolve of the
Easterlings and turned the tide of battle.*

The Evil force count as Broken for this Scenario, and must test to see if they flee; even though forces do not normally break in Narrative Play games.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the lands between Erebor and
Dale.

The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around. The northern board edge is the Lonely Mountain, in the centre of which are the gates of Erebor, which are 6" wide in
total.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their force within 12" of the centre of the northern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 24" of the southern board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

With hope renewed, this is the last chance for the Men and Dwarves to achieve victory and defeat the Easterling
invaders.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Bard II, Prince of Dale; Thorin III Stonehelm; Captain of Dale with shield; Iron Hills Dwarf
Captain;

21 Warriors of Dale: 6 with shield, 8 with spear and shield, 6 with Esgaroth bow, 1 with banner; 6 Knights of Dale; 25 Iron Hills Dwarves: 12 with spear, 6 with mattock, 6 with crossbow, 1 with banner.

Evil: The Dragon Emperor of Rhûn; Rutabi, General of the Dragon Legion; Brórgîr the Conjurer; Easterling Captain with shield; Easterling Dragon Knight; 21 Easterling Warriors: 8 with shield, 4 with shield and pike, 8 with bow, 1 with
banner;

18 Black Dragons: 9 with shield, 9 with pike and shield; 12 Dragon Cult Acolytes; 2 Rhûnish War
Drakes.

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to 25% of its starting numbers. The Good player wins if they can reduce the Evil force to 25%. The Evil player wins if they can reduce the Good player to 25%. If both forces are reduced to 25% in the same turn, the game is a
draw.

## GOLLUM'S ESCAPE

*OBJECTIVES*

With the attack of the Orcs and Wargs, Gollum sees a chance to escape his Elven captors. The Elves must fend off the assault and ensure that they do not let Gollum slip through their
fingers.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The Good player wins if at the end of any turn all the Orcs and Wargs have been slain. The Evil player wins immediately if Gollum escapes the board via the southern board
edge.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Gollum -- *The attack on the Elves has given Gollum an opportunity to sneak away unseen, and he will not risk being recaptured if he can help
it.*

Gollum does not have the Ring in this Scenario. Additionally, Gollum may not charge enemy models, though he will fight as normal if he is charged.

Elven Prisoner -- *Aragorn has entrusted Gollum to the Elves, and they will not bring harm upon the creature unless they have no other
option.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Mirkwood forest. As such, the board should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other appropriate undergrowth.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Evil player places Gollum in the centre of the
board.

The Good player then deploys their forces within 6" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then deploys the rest of their models within 6" of any board edge.

If Gollum is slain, the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Mirkwood Ranger Captain; 10 Mirkwood
Rangers.

Evil: Gollum; Orc Captain with shield; 12 Orc Warriors: 4 with shield, 4 with spear, 2 with two-handed weapon, 2 with Orc bow; 6 Fell Wargs.

## AN UNEASY ALLIANCE

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the dense wooded area of Mirkwood where the Spider Queen's lair resides. As such there should be plenty of trees, bushes and undergrowth dotted around. Four Spider Nests, no more than 6" in diameter should be placed on the board, one in the centre of each 2'x2' area of the board. In the centre of the eastern board edge is the entrance to the Spider Queen's lair, which is built into a rocky outcrop.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The 'Good' player deploys the Spider Queen, 2 Mirkwood Spiders, 2 Giant Spiders and the Bat Swarms within 12" of the entrance to the Spiders Queen's Lair. They then place one spider in each of the Spider Nests. The Evil player deploys their forces within 12" of the western board edge.


 

*OBJECTIVES*

The Orcs have ventured into the Spider Queen's lair with the intent of bending her to their will and getting her to join their fight against the Elves. However, being a vicious creature, the Spider Queen does not take kindly to those that enter her
lair.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The 'Good' player wins if they can reduce the Evil force to 25% of its starting numbers at the end of any turn. The Evil player wins if they can force the Spider Queen to submit and bend to their
will.

*SPECIAL RULES*

The Spider Queen -- *It is Razgûsh's plan to control the Spider Queen in order to get her to fight alongside them; yet to achieve this the
Orcs must cause her enough pain to force her to
submit.*

Once the Spider Queen has been wounded, there is a chance she will submit in order to survive. If during the End phase of any turn the Spider Queen has 2 or fewer Wounds remaining she must take a Courage test, which cannot be modified by Might or Will points. The third time this test is failed, the Spider Queen will submit to the Orcs and the game will
end.

We Need Her Alive -- *The Orcs are under strict instructions not to
kill the Spider Queen, as she is needed for the war with the
Elves.*

If the Spider Queen is slain, the game immediately ends and is a draw.

Spider Nests -- *The nests in the forest are home to the Spider
Queen's offspring and more will constantly come to her
aid.*

Evil models treat Spider Nests as difficult terrain. Additionally, whenever a Spider model is slain, keep it to one side. At the start of each turn, before Priority is determined, roll a D6 for each Spider model kept aside in this manner. On a 5+ that model will re-enter the board via one of the Spider Nests. To determine where they enter roll a further D6. On a 1-3 the Evil player chooses which Spider Nest the model enters from; on a 4+ the 'Good' player decides. Models that arrive in this manner are placed anywhere within or touching the Spider Nest and may act as normal that turn.

*PARTICIPANTS*

'Good': The Spider Queen; 4 Mirkwood Spiders; 4 Giant Spiders; 2 Bat Swarms.

Evil: Razgûsh, War Leader of the North; Orc Captain with shield; 24 Orc Warriors: 8 with shield, 8 with spear, 4 with two-handed weapon, 4 with Orc bow; 6 Warg Riders: 2 with shield, 2 with throwing spear, 2 with Orc

## ATTACK ON THE BEORNINGS

*LAYOUT*

The board represents a clearing near the Beorning homestead. The area within 12" of the centre of the board should be clear, whilst the rest of the board should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other undergrowth.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Beornings are fighting to stave off the assault on their home for long enough for Grimbeorn to return and aid them. The Orcs are simply out to slay the Beornings so that they cannot aid the Elves in Mirkwood.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good side wins if, at the end of the 10^th^ turn, there are at least four Beornings left alive. The Evil side wins if they can slay enough Beornings to prevent this. If Grimbeorn is slain, the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Grimbeorn -- *Grimbeorn has been out hunting the Orcs that are making their way through Mirkwood, but the sound of his people in trouble has forced him back towards his
homestead.*

From turn 2 onwards, roll a D6 at the start of each turn before Priority is determined and add the current turn
number.

On the score of 8 or more Grimbeorn has arrived. Grimbeorn will enter the board from the centre of any board edge via the rules for reinforcements. Additionally, Grimbeorn will already be in bear form so there is no need to
roll.

Unbridled Rage -- *Incensed that his people have been attacked in
their homes, Grimbeorn is prepared to unleash his full fury upon the
invaders.*

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys the Beornings within 6" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then splits their forces into two equal halves and deploys one half within 12" of the eastern board edge, and the other within 12" of the western board edge. Grimbeorn is kept aside for later in the game.

Grimbeorn must re-roll all failed To Wound
rolls.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Grimbeorn; 12 Beornings: 8 with hand-and-a-half axe, 4 with great bow.

Evil: 2 Orc Captains with shield; 24 Orc Warriors: 8 with shield, 8 with spear, 4 with two-handed weapon, 4 with Orc bow; 6 Warg Riders: 2 with shield, 2 with throwing spear, 2 with Orc bow; 6 Orc Trackers.

## BURNING OF MIRKWOOD

*4'*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Mirkwood forest and so should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other undergrowth. There should be five larger trees that are spread equidistantly along the centre line of the board from east to west; these are the
objectives.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the northern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 12" of the southern board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Orcs have come to burn down the Elven kingdom of Mirkwood, and plan on starting by torching some of the taller trees on the borders of their kingdom.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good player wins if at least three of the larger trees are still standing at the end of the
game.

The Evil player wins if at least three of the larger trees have been destroyed by the end of the game.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Destroying Trees -- *With axes and torches in hand, the Orcs have come to destroy the forest.*

During the End phase of each turn, any Orc model in base contact with one of the larger trees may attempt to destroy it, provided they have not fought in a combat, supported a combat or fired a missile weapon this turn or are Prone. When an Orc attempts to destroy a tree, their controlling player rolls a D6. On a 5+ that tree has been destroyed.

Timber! -- *When cut down, there is a chance that a falling tree will
land on the combatants below.*

Whenever a tree is destroyed, it will fall to the ground; roll a D6 to determine which way it falls and consult the chart
below:

The board represents an area of Mirkwood forest and so should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other
undergrowth.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Through the Forest -- *Having marched through the forest of Mirkwood, the forces of Mordor have learned how to traverse the thick-wooded terrain.*

Evil models gain the Woodland Creature special
rule.

Death to the Elves -- *The Orcs and beasts of Mirkwood have long hated the Elves of the Woodland Realm, and now they get their chance to bring death upon them.*

Evil models gain the Hatred (Elf) special

Razgûsh gains a bonus of +1 to his Fight value when engaged with an enemy Elf model.

Defend the Forest -- *The Elves know that this could be their end, and they will fight as hard as they are capable to
survive.*

Elf models must re-roll 1s To Wound during the Fight
phase.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the northern board edge, but not within 12" of either the eastern or western board edges. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 12" of the southern board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

The battle for Mirkwood has begun and both sides will use every ounce of strength to achieve victory.

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to 25% or less of its starting
numbers.

## CROSSING OF THE ANDUIN

*OBJECTIVES*

The Elves have seen the advancing Orcs and aim to prevent them from entering the Golden Wood.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The Evil player wins if 10 or more Evil models escape the board via the western board edge. The Good player wins if they can slay enough models to make it impossible for the Evil player to
win.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Defend our Borders -- *The Elves have come to the edge of the forest
in order to defend it, but they will not go further unless they have
to.*

Good models may not willingly move further than 12" away from the western board edge. If a Good model finds itself further than 12" from the western board edge at the start of its Move phase, it must try to move back within 12" if
possible.

The Anduin -- *The river is flowing fast, making it treacherous to try
to cross it anywhere except the ford.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents part of the River Anduin and the edges of Lothlórien. There should be a 6" wide river running down the centre of the board from north to south, in the centre of which should be a 6" wide ford for models to cross safely. The area within 12" of the western board edge is the forest of Lórien and should be densely packed with tress. The rest of the board should be relatively clear with the odd tree, bush or bit of shrubbery dotted around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their models within 12" of the western board edge. The Evil player then deploys their models within 12" of the eastern board edge.

The river is Deep Water, with the exception of the ford which is treated as open ground. Additionally, any model that makes a Swim test for trying to cross the Anduin suffers an additional -1 penalty to their roll.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Wood Elf Captain with Elf bow; 12 Wood Elf Warriors: 4 with throwing daggers, 4 with Wood Elf spear, 4 with Elf bow; 1 Wood Elf Sentinel.

Evil: Muzgúr, Orc Shaman; Orc Captain with shield; 12 Orc Warriors: 4 with shield, 4 with spear, 2 with two-handed weapon, 2 with Orc bow; 6 Warg Riders: 2 with shield, 2 with throwing spear, 2 with Orc bow; 6 Orc
Trackers.

## ATTACKON LÓRIEN

DURATION: INSTANT

*SPECIAL RULES*

The Mallorn Tree -- *This magnificent tree stands tall and proud within the forest and will not be easy to simply cut
down.*

The Mallorn tree has a Defence of 10 and 10 Wounds. Evil models may fight the Mallorn tree in the Fight phase, providing they have not already been or are in a Fight that turn, and have not made a shooting attack that turn. Models may use Special Strikes against the Mallorn tree, and may support models fighting the Mallorn tree. The Mallorn tree will always lose the fight, and always counts as Trapped.

Decay -- *The Orcs plan on using their crude magics to wither and
decay the Mallorn trees, causing them to become much
weaker.*

Muzgúr and the Orc Shaman gain the following additional Magical Power:

*DECAY*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Lothlórien, and as such should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other appropriate undergrowth. In the centre of the board should be a Mallorn tree with a trunk with a diameter of 3".

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the western board edge. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 12" of the eastern board edge.

This Magical Power may only target the Mallorn tree, has a range of 6" and is cast on a 4+. The Mallorn tree suffers a Wound. Additionally, it reduces its Defence characteristic by 1 for the remainder of the game.

Additionally, both Muzgúr and the Orc Shaman gain a free Will point per turn, however, this free Will point can only be used to cast the Decay Magical Power.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Mallorn trees within Lothlórien grow to immense heights and are the pride of the Golden Wood, and it is these trees that the Orcs plan to destroy.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good player wins if the Mallorn tree is still alive at the end of the game. The Evil player wins immediately if the Mallorn tree is
destroyed.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Orophin; Wood Elf Captain with Elf bow; 12 Galadhrim Warriors: 4 with shield, 4 with spear and shield, 4 with Elf bow; 12 Wood Elf Warriors: 4 with throwing daggers, 4 with Wood Elf spear, 4 with Elf

## TRAPPED ON BOTH SIDES

*OBJECTIVES*

With their reinforcements having arrived, the Elves are trying to fend off the combined forces of Orcs and Goblins from overrunning the forest.

The game lasts for 12 turns. At the end of the 12^th^ turn,
whichever side has the most models wholly within 6" of the centre of the board is the winner. If both sides have the same number of models wholly within 6" of the centre of the board, the game is a
draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Cover of Darkness -- *As the Goblins of the Misty Mountains cannot move by sunlight, the assault on Lothlórien comes during the dead of
night.*

The battle takes place at night. As such, due to the reduced visibility, models cannot be targeted by shooting, Magical Powers or special abilities over 12" away. However, as it is much harder to avoid a shot in the dark, all shooting attacks gain a bonus of +1 when rolling To Wound. Models with the Cave Dweller special rule can see as normal.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Lothlórien, and as such should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other appropriate undergrowth.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their force within 6" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then splits their force into two halves, one with all the Mordor models, and one with all the Moria and Spider models. The Mordor models are then deployed within 12" of the eastern board edge. The Moria and Spider models are then deployed within 12" of the western board
edge.

Dark Magics -- *Those that lead the Orcs and Goblins are well versed
in the crude sorceries they have been taught, and have shared their
knowledge with their allies.*

Evil models may re-roll any number of D6s when making a Casting roll.

Defend the Golden Wood -- *The Elves will hold their own against whatever comes out of the darkness.*

All Good models automatically pass any Courage tests they are required to make.

any other; should she fall then all hope will be
lost.*

If Galadriel is slain then the game immediately ends and the Evil side is victorious, regardless of any other
factors.

Cover of Darkness -- *As the Goblins of the Misty Mountains cannot move by sunlight, the assault on Lothlórien comes during the dead of
night.*

The battle takes place at night. As such, due to the reduced visibility, models cannot be targeted by shooting, Magical Powers or special abilities over 12" away. However, as it is much harder to avoid a shot in the dark, all shooting attacks gain a bonus of +1 when rolling To Wound. Models with the Cave Dweller special rule can see as normal.

Dark Magics -- *Those that lead the Orcs and Goblins are well versed
in the crude sorceries they have been taught, and have shared their

Galadhon.

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to 25% or less of its starting numbers. The Good player wins if the Evil force has been reduced to 25%.
