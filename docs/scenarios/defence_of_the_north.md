CROSSING OF THE RIVER CARNEN

*W*][*hen an envoy of the Dark Lord came
to the city of Dale in order to try to secure their allegiance, King Brand quickly dismissed them, stating firmly that he and his people would not bow to Sauron. Yet Brand knew that such an act would clearly incur the wrath of the Dark Lord, and so he began preparing Dale and its people for a potential attack that could come at any
time.*

*Though initially nothing came of Brand's encounter with the envoy, Sauron was biding his time; gathering his armies to strike out at his enemies simultaneously. When the time was right, Sauron sent a huge army from the east to assault both Erebor and Dale. When news of this advancing army reached the ears of Brand, he led a contingent of his army to confront them at the River Carnen
and try to negotiate.*

*Yet, when Brand and his people reached the banks of the river, the Easterling army was far bigger than they had ever imagined -- thousands of golden-clad warriors were relentlessly marching towards their lands. With no hope of a peaceful resolution, the only way to prevent the Easterling army from reaching Erebor and Dale was to stop them crossing the fast-flowing river.*

*Should Brand and his army succeed in pushing back the eastern threat upon the banks of the river then they might be able to prevent war on a massive scale. However, the army of Dale is severely outnumbered by the legions of Easterlings that have marched relentlessly from Rhûn, and
the odds are stacked against them. If Brand cannot hold back the
Easterlings as they approach the city, then their next act will be to wage war upon Dale and Erebor.*

*OBJECTIVES*

Brand has come to the banks of the River Carnen to negotiate with the Easterlings; however, Sauron's army will not be dissuaded and are intent on crossing the river and marching to
war.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Evil player wins if at least 33% of their models have reached the western side of the river by the end of the game. The Good player wins if they can prevent this. Additionally, if Brand is slain then the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

The River -- *The Carnen is fast flowing and dangerous to
cross.*

The River counts as Deep Water.

Onwards to Erebor! -- *The Easterlings are relentlessly marching to
the Lonely Mountain and will cut down any who stand in their
path.*

Easterling models may re-roll failed To Wound rolls in the Fight phase.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the River Carnen and the surrounding area. There should be a 6" wide river running through the centre of the board from north to south. In the centre of the board there should be a ford that is at least 6" wide that crosses the river, allowing
for an easy place for the forces to cross. The rest of the board should be relatively barren and so should have the odd tree, bush and hedge dotted around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the western board edge. The Evil player then deploys their force within 12" of the eastern board edge.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Brand, King of Dale; Captain of Dale with shield; 20 Warriors of Dale: 6 with shield, 8 with spear and shield, 6 with Esgaroth bow.

Evil: Rutabi, General of the Dragon Legion; Easterling Captain with armoured horse, sword and shield; Easterling War Priest; 20 Easterling Warriors:

8 with shield, 4 with pike and shield, 8 with
bow;

5 Easterling Kataphrakts.

[]{#bookmark9 .anchor}THE HOSTS CLASH

*H*][*aving been driven back from the
River Carnen, Brand and his people warn King Dáin of Erebor about the legions of Easterling warriors that are now all but on their doorstep. Upon hearing this news, Dáin readies his armies for war and prepares to stand alongside Brand and the people of Dale in defence of their lives and
homelands.*

*With the collective armies of Dale and Erebor gathered upon the
fields outside the Lonely Mountain, the armies of the Easterlings come into
view as they crest over the hills. Rank upon rank of Easterling warriors now bear down upon them, the sound of their relentless march heard across
the valley, and their golden armour glinting in the sunlight. At the head of
the army is the fabled Dragon Emperor of Rhûn himself; carried into battle atop his royal palanquin.*

*Pointing his blade towards the armies of Men and Dwarves, the Dragon Emperor commands his forces forwards into battle to claim Erebor and Dale in the name of the Dark Lord. Readying their weapons, Brand and Dáin begin their charge towards the golden host of the Dragon Emperor, preparing to fight side-by-side against seemingly impossible
odds. The Battle for Dale has begun.*

*SPECIAL RULES*

To War! -- *With the Battle of Dale having begun, both sides will
fight until the bitter end to achieve
victory.*

Models from both sides, apart from those armed with a bow, Esgaroth bow or crossbow, must Charge if able to do
so.

A Bond Forged in War -- *The friendship forged between the two kings, Dáin and Brand, is one that has stood for many years. Should either be in danger, the other will risk all to save
them.*

If either Dáin or Brand would be Trapped in the Fight phase, then the other may declare a Heroic Combat without spending Might. If successful, they must join their Trapped ally's fight if possible. If this is not possible, they must move as close as possible to their Trapped ally.

Heroes of the Easterlings -- *The Easterlings are a proud warrior culture whose leaders relish the chance to fight; and the assault on
Erebor provides them with a platform to claim the glory they
seek.*

*LAYOUT*

Easterling Hero models may re-roll a D6 in a Duel
roll.

The board represents the lands between Erebor and Dale. The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the northern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 12" of the southern board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Battle of Dale has begun, embroiling both sides in a desperate war. The game lasts for 15 turns; at which point the side which has killed the highest number of points worth of models is the winner.

Evil: The Dragon Emperor of Rhûn; Rutabi, General of the Dragon Legion; Brórgîr the Conjurer; Easterling Captain with armoured horse, sword and shield; Easterling War Priest; Easterling Dragon Knight; 31 Easterling Warriors: 12 with shield, 6 with shield and pike, 12 with bow, 1 with banner; 5 Easterling Kataphrakts; 18 Black Dragons: 9 with shield, 9 with pike and shield; 12 Dragon Cult Acolytes; 4 Rhûnish War Drakes.

*T*][*he Battle of Dale is well
underway; the armies of*

*Erebor and Dale are embroiled in a swirling melee against the golden host of the Dragon Emperor outside the gates of the Lonely Mountain. Man and Dwarf fight side-by-side as they attempt to quash the relentless advance of the Easterling army, though the Easterlings have by far superior numbers in the fight and are beginning to force their foes back towards Erebor with each
push.*

*As the battle continues, Dáin and Brand come to the realisation that they must hold important areas of the lands outside Erebor in order to anchor their forces to fend off the Easterlings. If these key
locations become overwhelmed by the Easterling forces then the armies of Dale and Erebor will become flanked on either side and unable to retreat should the need arise.*

*With a rousing cry, Dáin Ironfoot commands his Dwarves to begin to move further towards these areas of the battlefield, whilst Brand
relays the new orders to his warriors. However, the Dragon Emperor is no mere Easterling general but a veteran of many wars. Knowing full well the value of these areas to the armies of Erebor and Dale, the Dragon
Emperor has also commanded his forces to advance on these positions in an
attempt to cut off the Men and Dwarves from their
homes.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the lands between Erebor and
Dale.

The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around. There should be three Objective
Markers

on the board. The first is placed in the centre of the board. One is placed halfway between the centre of the board and the north-east corner of the board, whilst the final one is placed halfway between the centre of the board and the north-west corner of the
board.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their models anywhere within the northern half of the board. The Evil player then places their models anywhere within the southern half of the board, but not within 1" of an enemy model.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Easterlings have begun to force the alliance of Men and Dwarves back and now look to claim key areas of the battlefield. The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good player wins if they control at least two objectives at the end of the 10^th^ turn. The Evil player wins if they control at least two objectives at the end of the 10^th ^turn. Any other result is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Controlling Objectives -- *To control one of the key positions of the battlefield, one force must dominate that
area.*

An army is considered to be controlling an Objective Marker if there are more friendly models within 3" of the marker than enemy models. If both sides have the same number of models within 3" then neither side controls that Objective
Marker.

A Bond Forged in War -- *The friendship forged between the two kings, Dáin and Brand, is one that has stood for many years. Should either be in danger, the other will risk all to save
them.*

If either Dáin or Brand would be Trapped at the start of the Fight phase, then the other may declare a Heroic Combat without spending Might. If successful, they must join their Trapped ally's fight if possible. If this is not possible, they must move as close as possible to their Trapped ally.

Heroes of the Easterlings -- *The Easterlings are a proud warrior culture whose leaders relish the chance to fight; and the assault on

[Rhûnish War Drakes.[]{#bookmark14 .anchor}DEATH OF
BRAND

*T*][*he assault of the Easterling army
has proven to be devastating on the armies of Erebor and Dale, inflicting huge numbers of casualties upon them. Many Men and Dwarves have fallen defending their homes, and now the advancing hosts of the Dragon Emperor are closing in on those that survive; the sheer weight of numbers of the Easterlings proving to be too much for even these two renowned armies.*

*As the Easterlings have swept through the flanks of the army of Men, they have managed to cut off a section of the Dale forces from the rest
of the battle; a section of the army that includes Brand within its ranks. Suddenly, the King of Dale finds himself and a handful of the Knights of Dale surrounded by the golden-clad Easterlings and staring down almost certain death as Rutabi, one of the Dragon Emperor's most feared warriors, stands at the head of the Easterling
ranks.*

*Seeing that his friend of many years is trapped and faced with mortal danger, Dáin Ironfoot leads a group of nearby Dwarves to fight their
way through the Easterling ranks in order to save Brand. However, with the King of Dale facing down such a formidable foe, Dáin will have to fight harder than he has ever fought before if he is to reach Brand before it
is too late; and even if he does so it may not be
enough...*

*OBJECTIVES*

Brand has been separated from his allies, and Dáin must now fight his way to Brand's side before the Easterling forces overwhelm him. The game lasts for 10 turns, or until Brand is slain. The Good player wins if Brand is alive at the end of the game. The Evil player wins immediately if Brand is
slain.

STAND

*T*][*hough he was able to reach the
side of his friend amidst the swirling melee, ultimately Dáin was unable to prevent Brand from falling to the blades of the Easterlings and perishing on the fields outside Erebor. The sight of his dear friend being slain filled Dáin with an unbridled fury, which he unleashed upon all who stood before him.*

*Atop a small rocky outcrop, standing over the body of King Brand,
Dáin Ironfoot made his final stand against the golden hosts. Though there
would be little hope of Dáin surviving the battle himself, he would fight
with every ounce of strength he could muster to bring down as many of his
foes as he could to honour his fallen
friend.*

*With a rage burning inside him, Dáin felled Easterling after
Easterling as he fought to avenge his fallen ally. Swinging Barazantathûl in a
deadly arc, Dáin seemed to find much of the raw power of his youth, swatting aside countless foes. Yet Ironfoot and his fellow Dwarves that had
fought their way through to aid Brand were now themselves surrounded by a sea of gold and red.*

With both kings of the two great kingdoms slain, morale has begun to ebb away within the forces of Erebor and Dale.*

*Having seen their fathers perish, and their people severely
outnumbered and in danger of being overwhelmed themselves, Bard II and Thorin Stonehelm must take up command of their respective armies. However, the Easterling threat is too great and they have no choice but to order a
retreat to the relative safety of Erebor. Giving the command to fall back, Bard
and Thorin begin to lead their people towards the Lonely
Mountain.*

*However, seeing the princes beginning to retreat, the Dragon Emperor
has ordered his Easterlings to cut them off before they can reach the
mountain and slay them where they stand. As the Men and Dwarves retreat, the sea of golden armour begins to close in on either side and the chance of
escape grows increasingly slim. Those that remain must reach the gates of

The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around. The northern board edge is the Lonely Mountain, in the centre of which are the gates of Erebor, which are 6" wide in
total.

*OBJECTIVES*

With the armies of Erebor and Dale severely outnumbered, they must retreat to Erebor if they are to survive. However, the Easterling forces are trying to cut them off from the safety of the Lonely Mountain.

The game lasts until either the Good player completes their objective, or the Evil player kills enough Good models to make it impossible for the Good player to win. The Good player wins if 10 or more Good models move off the board via the gates of Erebor. The Evil player wins if they can prevent this.

*H*][*aving been driven back from the

Erebor*

*Dwarves and Men of Dale found themselves trapped within the mountain halls. The sheer number of Easterlings had proven too much for their combined forces; both kings lay dead on the plains outside, and now even Erebor itself was under siege and ready to fall.*

*Yet even though their chances of victory were all but extinguished,
Bard and Thorin would not surrender to the Easterlings; for they knew they would be shown no mercy at their hands. As the Easterling forces attempted to use their siege ladders to climb the walls of Erebor,
those inside the mountain fought to fend off their assault. Atop the walls,
Bard and Thorin led a desperate defence against their Rhûnish
foes.*

*The siege itself lasted for many days. Each time the Easterlings tried
to assail the walls, they were somehow driven back by the sheer
determination of those that defended the mountain -- with each assault, the numbers of Men and Dwarves dwindling. Sensing the chance to finally see his forces break through the ranks of Erebor and Dale, the Dragon Emperor ordered one more push to claim the walls, and sent his best warriors to deliver them to him.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the battlements of Erebor and the siege ladders propped up against the walls. The area within 9" of the northern board edge is the battlements, and so should be relatively clear. There are five siege ladders in this battle, spaced out as shown on the map. The area within 3" of the southern board edge is the plains outside Erebor -- and is rather a long way
down!

*SPECIAL RULES*

Numbers beyond Count -- *The Easterlings constantly scale the walls, with more climbing the siege ladders to join the
battle.*

Each time an Easterling Warrior is slain, keep it to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase, any models kept aside in this manner may move onto the board from the siege ladders. Models that arrive in this way may Charge in the turn in which they arrive. Any models that cannot move onto the board in this way are kept aside for the next turn.

Battlements of Erebor -- *The height of the walls of Erebor means that any warrior unfortunate enough to fall from them will meet an untimely death.*

The southern edge of the walls of Erebor is lined with battlements that can trap a model against them. Additionally, a model that is pushed from the battlements and onto the ground below is automatically slain -- it's a rather steep
fall!

*W*][*ith the armies of Erebor and Dale
being forced to retreat back into the Lonely Mountain, the Battle of Dale came to an end with the Easterlings victorious. Yet the war was not yet over, as the Easterlings besieged Erebor in an attempt to finally crush those that had stood against the Dark Lord once and for all. For days, the Easterlings unsuccessfully attempted to breach the walls of Erebor, each time forced back by those that still defended
it.*

*However, when it seemed only a matter of time before the gates would be breached, fortune smiled upon the Men and Dwarves held up within Erebor. As the siege of Erebor had been underway, Frodo Baggins of the Shire had managed to climb Mount Doom and cast the One Ring into its fires; destroying it and, with it, the Dark Lord himself. News
of Sauron's defeat had taken two days to reach the ears of the Easterlings but with it came doubt and panic, and a renewed hope for those trapped within the mountain.*

*As disarray set in amongst the Easterlings, Bard and Thorin gathered together every last Man and Dwarf within Erebor and armed them ready for one final push against their invaders. With hope now on their side,
and the host of the Dragon Emperor showing signs of cracking, the heirs of
the kingdoms of Erebor and Dale opened the gates to the Lonely Mountain and led their people in one final charge to break the lines of their
foes and attempt to claim victory.*

*SPECIAL RULES*

The Heirs to the Kingdoms -- *When their fathers perished upon the field of battle, the new kings of Dale and Erebor continued to honour
the alliance that had stood between their people, protecting their allies as
their fathers had done.*

If either Thorin III Stonehelm or Bard II would be Trapped in the Fight phase, the other may declare a Heroic Combat without spending Might. If successful, they must join their Trapped ally's fight if possible. If this is not possible, they must move as close as possible to their Trapped ally.

Broken Morale -- *News of the Dark Lord's defeat and the destruction of the black tower of Barad-dûr has sapped the resolve of the
Easterlings and turned the tide of battle.*

The Evil force count as Broken for this Scenario, and must test to see if they flee; even though forces do not normally break in Narrative Play games.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the lands between Erebor and
Dale.

The lands themselves are relatively barren and should have a few hedges, bushes, rocky outcrops and other shrubbery dotted around. The northern board edge is the Lonely Mountain, in the centre of which are the gates of Erebor, which are 6" wide in
total.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their force within 12" of the centre of the northern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 24" of the southern board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

With hope renewed, this is the last chance for the Men and Dwarves to achieve victory and defeat the Easterling
invaders.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Bard II, Prince of Dale; Thorin III Stonehelm; Captain of Dale with shield; Iron Hills Dwarf
Captain;

21 Warriors of Dale: 6 with shield, 8 with spear and shield, 6 with Esgaroth bow, 1 with banner; 6 Knights of Dale; 25 Iron Hills Dwarves: 12 with spear, 6 with mattock, 6 with crossbow, 1 with banner.

Evil: The Dragon Emperor of Rhûn; Rutabi, General of the Dragon Legion; Brórgîr the Conjurer; Easterling Captain with shield; Easterling Dragon Knight; 21 Easterling Warriors: 8 with shield, 4 with shield and pike, 8 with bow, 1 with
banner;

18 Black Dragons: 9 with shield, 9 with pike and shield; 12 Dragon Cult Acolytes; 2 Rhûnish War
Drakes.

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to 25% of its starting numbers. The Good player wins if they can reduce the Evil force to 25%. The Evil player wins if they can reduce the Good player to 25%. If both forces are reduced to 25% in the same turn, the game is a
draw.

*H*][*aving lost the precious to the
Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, in his cave, the creature Gollum had ventured out of the Misty Mountains in the hope of tracking down Bilbo and reclaiming the Ring for himself. For many years, he wandered the wilderness in his search for the Ring, but to no avail. As he scoured Middle-earth, Gollum found himself drawn southwards, and on the edges of the lands of Mordor the forces of the Dark Lord captured
him.*

*Tortured within the tower of Barad-dûr about the whereabouts of the One Ring, Gollum could only offer up two words: 'Shire' and 'Baggins'. Eventually, Gollum was set free from the confines of Mordor and once more he began his search for the Ring. However, soon after his release, Gollum was captured by Aragorn who took him northwards to Mirkwood to be imprisoned, so that the Elves might learn from the creature what
he had told the enemy of what he knew of the
Ring.*

*Whilst keeping him prisoner within the halls of the Elvenking, the
Elves took some level of pity upon Gollum, and he was allowed time to climb the trees of the forest, so long as he was guarded. During one trip
outside, a band of Orcs attacked the Elves guarding Gollum. Whether these Orcs were sent by Sauron to ensure Gollum was set free to continue his
search for the Ring, or whether they had simply attacked Mirkwood on a whim was of no consequence to Gollum; all he knew was that his chance to escape had arrived...*

*OBJECTIVES*

With the attack of the Orcs and Wargs, Gollum sees a chance to escape his Elven captors. The Elves must fend off the assault and ensure that they do not let Gollum slip through their
fingers.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The Good player wins if at the end of any turn all the Orcs and Wargs have been slain. The Evil player wins immediately if Gollum escapes the board via the southern board
edge.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Gollum -- *The attack on the Elves has given Gollum an opportunity to sneak away unseen, and he will not risk being recaptured if he can help
it.*

Gollum does not have the Ring in this Scenario. Additionally, Gollum may not charge enemy models, though he will fight as normal if he is charged.

Elven Prisoner -- *Aragorn has entrusted Gollum to the Elves, and they will not bring harm upon the creature unless they have no other
option.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Mirkwood forest. As such, the board should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other appropriate undergrowth.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Evil player places Gollum in the centre of the
board.

The Good player then deploys their forces within 6" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then deploys the rest of their models within 6" of any board edge.

If Gollum is slain, the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Mirkwood Ranger Captain; 10 Mirkwood
Rangers.

Evil: Gollum; Orc Captain with shield; 12 Orc Warriors: 4 with shield, 4 with spear, 2 with two-handed weapon, 2 with Orc bow; 6 Fell Wargs.

[]{#bookmark29 .anchor}AN UNEASY
ALLIANCE

*A*][*s the Easterling host wages war
upon the kingdoms of Erebor and Dale, Sauron has sent an army of Orcs northwards to attack the Elven kingdom within Mirkwood in order to prevent Thranduil from leading his people to aid the Men and Dwarves at the Lonely Mountain. Sauron's plan is to have this army of Orcs crush Thranduil's people before marching southwards and converging upon Lothlórien to destroy the Golden Wood.*

*Command of this army of Orcs has been entrusted to the war leader known as Razgûsh, a cunning and vicious Orc who has fought many wars and skirmishes against the Elves of Middle-earth. As Razgûsh leads his armies northwards, he hatches a plan to give his forces an edge in the upcoming battles. The forest of
Mirkwood is home to many vile creatures that, if they can be forced to join the
Orcs' march northwards, will be deadly allies against the Elves of the forest
-- and one creature in particular could prove to be the very thing
Razgûsh's army needs to secure victory.*

*Deep within the forest resides the Spider Queen; a spawn of Ungoliant herself. This huge and bloated arachnid dwells within her lair, and it
is there that Razgûsh plans to force her to submit to his will. Yet the
Spider Queen does not take kindly to those that enter her domain, and she will certainly not pass up the opportunity of a free meal that has wandered into her lair. If Razgûsh's plan is to work, his Orcs must now fend off
the Spiders of Mirkwood and avoid becoming the Spider Queen's next
victims!*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents the dense wooded area of Mirkwood where the Spider Queen's lair resides. As such there should be plenty of trees, bushes and undergrowth dotted around. Four Spider Nests, no more than 6" in diameter should be placed on the board, one in the centre of each 2'x2' area of the board. In the centre of the eastern board edge is the entrance to the Spider Queen's lair, which is built into a rocky outcrop.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The 'Good' player deploys the Spider Queen, 2 Mirkwood Spiders, 2 Giant Spiders and the Bat Swarms within 12" of the entrance to the Spiders Queen's Lair. They then place one spider in each of the Spider Nests. The Evil player deploys their forces within 12" of the western board edge.

height="2.873611111111111in"}

 

*OBJECTIVES*

The Orcs have ventured into the Spider Queen's lair with the intent of bending her to their will and getting her to join their fight against the Elves. However, being a vicious creature, the Spider Queen does not take kindly to those that enter her
lair.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The 'Good' player wins if they can reduce the Evil force to 25% of its starting numbers at the end of any turn. The Evil player wins if they can force the Spider Queen to submit and bend to their
will.

*SPECIAL RULES*

The Spider Queen -- *It is Razgûsh's plan to control the Spider Queen in order to get her to fight alongside them; yet to achieve this the
Orcs must cause her enough pain to force her to
submit.*

Once the Spider Queen has been wounded, there is a chance she will submit in order to survive. If during the End phase of any turn the Spider Queen has 2 or fewer Wounds remaining she must take a Courage test, which cannot be modified by Might or Will points. The third time this test is failed, the Spider Queen will submit to the Orcs and the game will
end.

We Need Her Alive -- *The Orcs are under strict instructions not to
kill the Spider Queen, as she is needed for the war with the
Elves.*

If the Spider Queen is slain, the game immediately ends and is a draw.

Spider Nests -- *The nests in the forest are home to the Spider
Queen's offspring and more will constantly come to her
aid.*

Evil models treat Spider Nests as difficult terrain. Additionally, whenever a Spider model is slain, keep it to one side. At the start of each turn, before Priority is determined, roll a D6 for each Spider model kept aside in this manner. On a 5+ that model will re-enter the board via one of the Spider Nests. To determine where they enter roll a further D6. On a 1-3 the Evil player chooses which Spider Nest the model enters from; on a 4+ the 'Good' player decides. Models that arrive in this manner are placed anywhere within or touching the Spider Nest and may act as normal that turn.

*PARTICIPANTS*

'Good': The Spider Queen; 4 Mirkwood Spiders; 4 Giant Spiders; 2 Bat Swarms.

Evil: Razgûsh, War Leader of the North; Orc Captain with shield; 24 Orc Warriors: 8 with shield, 8 with spear, 4 with two-handed weapon, 4 with Orc bow; 6 Warg Riders: 2 with shield, 2 with throwing spear, 2 with Orc

BEORNINGS

*A*][*s the forces of the Dark Lord
marched northwards through Mirkwood, it was not just the Elves that were caught up in the Orcs' desire to wage war. Towards the edge of the forest resided the Beornings, followers of the descendants of Beorn the great skin-changer. A peaceful people, the Beornings have kept the paths through the vales of Anduin free from evil creatures, providing safe passage to friendly folk.*

*The Beornings are the allies of the Elves of Mirkwood, and would
fight alongside them if they were needed. Not wanting to have to fight both
the Beornings and the Elves, Razgûsh dispatched a smaller force of Orcs to the Beorning homestead to engage them in combat far away from the halls of the Elvenking. Even as the Beornings prepared to aid their allies,
the Orcs attacked them in their homes, forcing them into a battle they were
not yet prepared for.*

*Grimbeorn, the son of Beorn, had set about hunting the main army of
Orcs that marched northwards, however, the sound of his people being
attacked had forced him to transform into his huge, bear-like form and race to
their aid. Yet even as he relentlessly bounds through the forest, his people
are surrounded and outnumbered; if Grimbeorn doesn't arrive in time, they may well perish at the hands of the
Orcs.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents a clearing near the Beorning homestead. The area within 12" of the centre of the board should be clear, whilst the rest of the board should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other undergrowth.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Beornings are fighting to stave off the assault on their home for long enough for Grimbeorn to return and aid them. The Orcs are simply out to slay the Beornings so that they cannot aid the Elves in Mirkwood.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good side wins if, at the end of the 10^th^ turn, there are at least four Beornings left alive. The Evil side wins if they can slay enough Beornings to prevent this. If Grimbeorn is slain, the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Grimbeorn -- *Grimbeorn has been out hunting the Orcs that are making their way through Mirkwood, but the sound of his people in trouble has forced him back towards his
homestead.*

From turn 2 onwards, roll a D6 at the start of each turn before Priority is determined and add the current turn
number.

On the score of 8 or more Grimbeorn has arrived. Grimbeorn will enter the board from the centre of any board edge via the rules for reinforcements. Additionally, Grimbeorn will already be in bear form so there is no need to
roll.

Unbridled Rage -- *Incensed that his people have been attacked in
their homes, Grimbeorn is prepared to unleash his full fury upon the
invaders.*

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys the Beornings within 6" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then splits their forces into two equal halves and deploys one half within 12" of the eastern board edge, and the other within 12" of the western board edge. Grimbeorn is kept aside for later in the game.

Grimbeorn must re-roll all failed To Wound
rolls.

*PARTICIPANTS*

Good: Grimbeorn; 12 Beornings: 8 with hand-and-a-half axe, 4 with great bow.

Evil: 2 Orc Captains with shield; 24 Orc Warriors: 8 with shield, 8 with spear, 4 with two-handed weapon, 4 with Orc bow; 6 Warg Riders: 2 with shield, 2 with throwing spear, 2 with Orc bow; 6 Orc Trackers.

Led by their captains, a contingent of golden-clad Elves march to meet the threat of Mordor head-on, whilst a band of rangers sneak quietly through the trees alongside
them.*

*Yet it is when the Mordor forces come into view that the Elves
realise quite how dire their situation really is. The Orc army is far larger
than Thranduil had originally anticipated, and they are accompanied by the vile and evil creatures that dwell in the forest. This combined army of
Orcs and beasts is set upon destroying the Elves of Mirkwood, and they plan
on razing the kingdom of the Elvenking to the ground one tree at a
time.*

*Seeing that they are outnumbered and in need of reinforcements,
messengers are sent back to Thranduil to inform him of the threat now facing his kingdom. Those Elves that now face the might of Mordor will not flee; instead they engage the Orcs and beasts in a clash of blades around the trees. Yet even whilst the Elves fight to stave off the Orcs, Spiders
and other foul creatures, Razgûsh's host has already set about destroying areas of

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Mirkwood forest and so should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other undergrowth. There should be five larger trees that are spread equidistantly along the centre line of the board from east to west; these are the
objectives.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the northern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 12" of the southern board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Orcs have come to burn down the Elven kingdom of Mirkwood, and plan on starting by torching some of the taller trees on the borders of their kingdom.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good player wins if at least three of the larger trees are still standing at the end of the
game.

The Evil player wins if at least three of the larger trees have been destroyed by the end of the game.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Destroying Trees -- *With axes and torches in hand, the Orcs have come to destroy the forest.*

During the End phase of each turn, any Orc model in base contact with one of the larger trees may attempt to destroy it, provided they have not fought in a combat, supported a combat or fired a missile weapon this turn or are Prone. When an Orc attempts to destroy a tree, their controlling player rolls a D6. On a 5+ that tree has been destroyed.

Timber! -- *When cut down, there is a chance that a falling tree will
land on the combatants below.*

Whenever a tree is destroyed, it will fall to the ground; roll a D6 to determine which way it falls and consult the chart

*H*][*aving received the message
requesting reinforcements from his people in the forest, the grim realisation of the size of the force the Elves are up against has finally hit Thranduil. Though he initially wanted to keep his people out of the wars that were being fought to the south, war has now come upon the Elvenking and he has little choice but to gather the rest of his armies and prepare for battle.*

*With his full strength gathered, Thranduil leads the rest of his
armies south to where the remainder of his forces have managed to hold off the hordes of Mordor and the forest creatures. Yet even with the full might of his halls, Thranduil's armies are still outnumbered by the amassed numbers of Orcs, Wargs and the vile creatures that have lurked in the depths of Mirkwood and hunted his
people.*

*At the head of the Orc army, Razgûsh leads his Orcs in a terrifying
war chant, whilst the Spider Queen herself can be seen gathering her kin to her side to unleash them upon the Elves.

*S*][*auron's assault on Middle-earth is
underway. To*

*the south, a legion of Orcs prepares to assail Minas Tirith, whilst to the north a host of Easterlings march upon Erebor and an army of Orcs are making their way through Mirkwood to assault the Woodland Realm. Yet Sauron still fears the power of Galadriel, so in an attempt to buy his forces enough time to crush Erebor and Dale, he sends a separate army to Lothlórien in order to wage war upon the Golden Wood.*

*However, Sauron's plan is not for this army to achieve victory alone;
in fact the army itself is simply not large enough to do so. Instead, the
Dark Lord plans for this army of Orcs to keep the forces of Lothlórien at bay
for long enough that his other armies in the north can crush those that
stand against him, before Orcs and Easterlings alike congregate upon
Lothlórien in order to overwhelm them and bring the Woodland Realm to its
knees.*

*To enter the Golden Wood, the forces of Mordor must first cross the
fast- flowing waters of the Anduin; a fact that Galadriel well knows. A band of Wood Elves has been commanded to stand guard on the edge of the forest to the east near a ford in the river, the ideal place for the
Orcs to cross. As the Orcs approach the River Anduin, the Elves begin to unleash
a hail of arrows towards the would-be invaders in the hope of driving
them backwards and away from Lothlórien.*

*OBJECTIVES*

The Elves have seen the advancing Orcs and aim to prevent them from entering the Golden Wood.

The game lasts until one force has completed their objective. The Evil player wins if 10 or more Evil models escape the board via the western board edge. The Good player wins if they can slay enough models to make it impossible for the Evil player to
win.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Defend our Borders -- *The Elves have come to the edge of the forest
in order to defend it, but they will not go further unless they have
to.*

Good models may not willingly move further than 12" away from the western board edge. If a Good model finds itself further than 12" from the western board edge at the start of its Move phase, it must try to move back within 12" if
possible.

The Anduin -- *The river is flowing fast, making it treacherous to try
to cross it anywhere except the ford.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents part of the River Anduin and the edges of Lothlórien. There should be a 6" wide river running down the centre of the board from north to south, in the centre of which should be a 6" wide ford for models to cross safely. The area within 12" of the western board edge is the forest of Lórien and should be densely packed with tress. The rest of the board should be relatively clear with the odd tree, bush or bit of shrubbery dotted around.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their models within 12" of the western board edge. The Evil player then deploys their models within 12" of the eastern board edge.

The river is Deep Water, with the exception of the ford which is treated as open ground. Additionally, any model that makes a Swim test for trying to cross the Anduin suffers an additional -1 penalty to their roll.

*L*][*othlórien is home to the fabled
Mallorn; huge trees that grow far taller and stronger than any others in the forest. These trees once grew in Valinor and it was Galadriel that brought some of the Mallorn seeds with her when she settled in Lothlórien. The Mallorn trees sprout great leaves that turn a glorious golden colour in the Autumn and Winter; and it is because of this that Lothlórien is often referred to as the Golden
Wood.*

*It is these Mallorn trees that the Orcs plan to destroy as they cut
their way through the forest. Sauron knows that Elves hold the Mallorn in such
high regard and believes that their destruction would demoralise them,
allowing his armies to conquer Lothlórien. However, the Elves will fiercely
protect the Mallorn trees from any potential harm, and have sent an army of Galadhrim to fight against the Orcs that now threaten to cut them
down.*

*Now an army of Galadhrim warriors has joined the Wood Elves of the forest as they fight to defend the Mallorn from the Orcs that seek
to destroy them. Yet the Orcs bring with them something the Elves have not anticipated. The Orc Shamans that march with the Mordor armies have been trained in a crude form of magic, and possess the power to wither
and rot the Mallorn trees from the inside should they be able to get near
enough to the trunks of the trees.*

DURATION: INSTANT

*SPECIAL RULES*

The Mallorn Tree -- *This magnificent tree stands tall and proud within the forest and will not be easy to simply cut
down.*

The Mallorn tree has a Defence of 10 and 10 Wounds. Evil models may fight the Mallorn tree in the Fight phase, providing they have not already been or are in a Fight that turn, and have not made a shooting attack that turn. Models may use Special Strikes against the Mallorn tree, and may support models fighting the Mallorn tree. The Mallorn tree will always lose the fight, and always counts as Trapped.

Decay -- *The Orcs plan on using their crude magics to wither and
decay the Mallorn trees, causing them to become much
weaker.*

Muzgúr and the Orc Shaman gain the following additional Magical Power:

*DECAY*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Lothlórien, and as such should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other appropriate undergrowth. In the centre of the board should be a Mallorn tree with a trunk with a diameter of 3".

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their forces within 12" of the western board edge. The Evil player then deploys their forces within 12" of the eastern board edge.

This Magical Power may only target the Mallorn tree, has a range of 6" and is cast on a 4+. The Mallorn tree suffers a Wound. Additionally, it reduces its Defence characteristic by 1 for the remainder of the game.

Additionally, both Muzgúr and the Orc Shaman gain a free Will point per turn, however, this free Will point can only be used to cast the Decay Magical Power.

*OBJECTIVES*

The Mallorn trees within Lothlórien grow to immense heights and are the pride of the Golden Wood, and it is these trees that the Orcs plan to destroy.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good player wins if the Mallorn tree is still alive at the end of the game. The Evil player wins immediately if the Mallorn tree is
destroyed.

[]{#bookmark44 .anchor}TRAPPED ON BOTH
SIDES

*T*][*he Mordor assault on Lothlórien
has not gone unnoticed by other unsavoury beings that have long sought to attack the borders of the Golden Wood. The sound of the Elves and Orcs fighting within the trees has reached the pointed ears of those Goblins from the Misty Mountains that no longer dwell within the mountains themselves, but instead live at their base amongst the fell creatures that also make the foot of the mountains their home.*

*Upon hearing the Orcs' assault upon Lórien, the Goblin Shamans that have taken up the mantle of leading the Goblins and beasts at the foot of the Misty Mountains see an opportunity to join the war against the Elves and bring ruin and death upon the Galadhrim. Gathering as many of their kin, and other vile creatures, as they can, the Goblins known as Drûzhag and Ashrâk lead them east into the Golden Wood and towards war.*

*Whilst Orophin has been leading the Elves against the Orcs of Mordor, reinforcements led by his brother Rúmil have made their way from Caras Galadhon to aid those already in battle. However, the arrival of Rúmil is followed swiftly by nightfall and a band of Goblins of the Misty Mountains; and now the Galadhrim find themselves trapped between an army of Orcs to the east and a horde of Goblins to the west who both
seek to bring death upon them.*

*OBJECTIVES*

With their reinforcements having arrived, the Elves are trying to fend off the combined forces of Orcs and Goblins from overrunning the forest.

The game lasts for 12 turns. At the end of the 12^th^ turn,
whichever side has the most models wholly within 6" of the centre of the board is the winner. If both sides have the same number of models wholly within 6" of the centre of the board, the game is a
draw.

*SPECIAL RULES*

Cover of Darkness -- *As the Goblins of the Misty Mountains cannot move by sunlight, the assault on Lothlórien comes during the dead of
night.*

The battle takes place at night. As such, due to the reduced visibility, models cannot be targeted by shooting, Magical Powers or special abilities over 12" away. However, as it is much harder to avoid a shot in the dark, all shooting attacks gain a bonus of +1 when rolling To Wound. Models with the Cave Dweller special rule can see as normal.

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Lothlórien, and as such should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other appropriate undergrowth.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their force within 6" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then splits their force into two halves, one with all the Mordor models, and one with all the Moria and Spider models. The Mordor models are then deployed within 12" of the eastern board edge. The Moria and Spider models are then deployed within 12" of the western board
edge.

Dark Magics -- *Those that lead the Orcs and Goblins are well versed
in the crude sorceries they have been taught, and have shared their
knowledge with their allies.*

Evil models may re-roll any number of D6s when making a Casting roll.

Defend the Golden Wood -- *The Elves will hold their own against whatever comes out of the darkness.*

All Good models automatically pass any Courage tests they are required to make.

[]{#bookmark47 .anchor}FINAL ASSAULT ON
LOTHLÓRIEN

*L*][*othlórien has been embroiled in
all-out war. The Orc army that marched from Mordor has been joined by a rabble of Goblins, Wargs and other creatures that have come from the base of the Misty Mountains. Together they have forced the Galadhrim armies back to Caras Galadhon and now they prepare to launch one final attack on the Elven city with the intent of conquering it in the Dark Lord's name.*

*Under the cover of darkness, Muzgúr leads his Orcs north towards
Caras Galadhon, whilst Drûzhag and Ashrâk command the Goblins and beasts to follow. Though the plan was originally to have had reinforcements
from Sauron's forces in Mirkwood and Erebor, the Orcs instead have the Moria Goblins as their allies and so prepare to launch the final assault upon
the Elves of the Golden Wood.*

*However, Caras Galadhon is well defended. The brothers Rúmil and Orophin command the golden-clad warriors of the Galadhrim and the Wardens of Caras Galadhon, the most elite of all of Lothlórien's
warriors. Even Galadriel and Celeborn have come to fight against the threat of Mordor, for they know that their people will require every ounce of
strength and courage to overcome the combined forces of Orcs and Goblins that
now seek to destroy them.*

*SPECIAL RULES*

Galadriel -- *The Dark Lord fears the power of Galadriel more than
any other; should she fall then all hope will be
lost.*

If Galadriel is slain then the game immediately ends and the Evil side is victorious, regardless of any other
factors.

Cover of Darkness -- *As the Goblins of the Misty Mountains cannot move by sunlight, the assault on Lothlórien comes during the dead of
night.*

The battle takes place at night. As such, due to the reduced visibility, models cannot be targeted by shooting, Magical Powers or special abilities over 12" away.

Dark Magics -- *Those that lead the Orcs and Goblins are well versed
in the crude sorceries they have been taught, and have shared their
knowledge with their allies.*

*LAYOUT*

The board represents an area of Lothlórien, and as such should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other appropriate undergrowth. Galadriel's mirror is deployed 12" from the centre of the northern board edge as shown on the
map.

*STARTING POSITIONS*

The Good player deploys their force within 12" of the centre of the northern board edge. The Evil player then deploys their force within 12" of the southern board edge.

*OBJECTIVES*

This is the final assault of Lothlórien and the combined forces of Orcs and Goblins have come to destroy Caras
Galadhon.

The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to 25% or less of its starting numbers. The Good player wins if the Evil force has been reduced to 25%. The Evil force wins if the Good force has been reduced to 25%. If both sides are reduced to 25% in the same turn, the game is a draw.

Evil models may re-roll any number of D6s when making a Casting roll.

.anchor}FALL OF DOL GULDUR

*T*][*he Dark Lord's plan has failed.
Sauron's army of Orcs in Mirkwood has been defeated, and the Easterling hosts have been driven back from Erebor. As such, neither were able to converge upon Lothlórien and join the final assault on the Golden Wood. Though the combined forces of Orcs and Goblins managed to destroy parts of Lórien forest, they have ultimately been defeated by the armies of the Galadhrim.*

*With news that the One Ring has been destroyed and Sauron finally defeated reaching the ears of the Elves, Galadriel sets out for Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood to destroy the final bastion of the Dark Lord. To accompany the Lady of Lothlórien, Celeborn brings with him as many of the remaining Galadhrim forces as he can muster in order to protect Galadriel as she uses her immense power to fell the stronghold of Dol Guldur.*

*Yet the fortress of Dol Guldur is still protected by those loyal to
the Dark Lord, and if Galadriel is to succeed in breaking the incantations that
still linger and tearing the fortress down then the Galadhrim will have to
stave off those that defend it. Bands of Orcs and Wargs still roam the ruins,
and foul Mirkwood Spiders from the forest are drawn to the sound of battle
in search of a quick meal.*

*However, perhaps the deadliest of those that defend the walls of Dol Guldur are the Castellans; spectral automatons that have long been
tasked with protecting this bastion of the Dark Lord's power and, even with Sauron defeated, they will stop at nothing to ensure it still stands. As
the Galadhrim enter the ruins of Dol Guldur, the Castellans come forth from the shadows intent on slaying those who have dared enter this place of
evil.*
