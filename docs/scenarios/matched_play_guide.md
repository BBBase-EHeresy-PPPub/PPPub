[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[Victory goes to the force which can crush the foe and slay the enemy leader.]

[THE ARMIES]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force to deploy within 12" of their board edge. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their
warband.]

[When this has been done, the opposing player chooses one of their warbands and deploys it within 12" of their board edge, as described above. Players then alternate until all warbands have been placed.]

[ ]

[INITIAL PRIORITY]

[Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.]

[OBJECTIVES]

[The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models or below, at which point the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. Once the battlefield has been set up, an Objective marker is placed in the centre of the battlefield. Players must also agree which direction is north — this is important for determining where and when Reinforcements arrive from.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[At the battle's start, the forces are yet to arrive — models are not deployed at the start of the game, but will enter as the game continues (see Special Rules later).]

[INITIAL PRIORITY]

[Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.]

[OBJECTIVES]

[Once one force has been Broken, the game might suddenly end. At the end of each turn, after this condition has been met, roll a D6. On a 1-2, the game ends — otherwise, the battle continues for another turn.]

[At the end of the game, the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.]

1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader (Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count). If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at
the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score 3 Victory Points.SPECIAL
RULES]

[Maelstrom of Battle: At the end of your Move phase, roll a D6 for each of your warbands not on the battlefield and consult the chart below (the warband's captain can use Might to alter the roll either up or down). Models can't charge in the turn that they arrive but otherwise act normally. Roll for each warband separately, deploy the models in the warband (if the D6 allows) then roll for the next. Warbands yet to arrive count as being on the battlefield for the purposes of determining if your force is Broken.]

Your Wound Tally is equal to the number of Wounds that your army inflicted upon your opponent's army, plus any Fate points that your opponent pent. Hero models that are removed from the game with unspent Fate points will add 1 to the Wound Tally for each one unspent. Models that flee because their force is Broken count towards the Wound Tally, but mounts that flee do not. You score 3 Victory Points if your Wound Tally is greater than your opponent's. If your Wound Tally is at least twice as large as your opponent's, then you instead score 5 Victory Points. If your Wound Tally is at least three times as large as your opponent's, or your opponent has no models left on the board, then you instead score 7 Victory Points.You score 1
Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader (Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count). If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken at
the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken and your force is unbroken, you instead score 3 Victory Points.SPECIAL

[Reinforcements: At the end of your Move phase, roll a D6 for each of your warbands that are not on the battlefield and consult the chart below (the warband's captain can use Might to alter the roll). Models enter the board via the rules for Reinforcements (see page 33 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules
manual).]

[Roll for each warband separately, deploy the models in the warband, then roll for the next. Warbands yet to arrive count as being on the battlefield for determining if your force is Broken. Warbands that have still not arrived by the start of the fourth turn will automatically arrive on turn 4.]

[*By holding key strategic points, both armies believe they can control
the field of battle and use these tactically important locations to
force their enemy into defeat. Whoever controls the battlefield will have gained an important
foothold for the many battles yet to
come.*]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. Then, place five Objective markers on the battlefield; one is automatically placed in the centre of the board. One Objective is placed exactly halfway between the centre of the board and the centre of the northern table edge. The other three Objective markers are deployed in the same way in relation to the east, south and west board edges respectively (see map).]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force and roll a D6.]

[Players then take it in turns (starting with the player who rolled highest) to select a warband in their force and roll a

The player with the highest score places one Objective marker anywhere on the battlefield at least 6" away from any board edge. Their opponent then places an Objective at least 12" away from the existing Objective marker and 6" away from any board edge. The players then alternate placing the remaining Objectives, according to the restriction noted
earlier.]

[Uncovering the Relic: Only one of the Objective markers is actually the relic that both sides seek. The first time each turn an unengaged Infantry model ends its movement in base contact with an Objective, they may search it in an attempt to uncover the relic. When this happens roll a D6. On a 6, the relic has been discovered and the model that discovered it takes possession of it (Might cannot be used to influence this roll). If the roll is a 1-5 then the relic is
not there, remove the Objective from play. If the first five Objective markers to be searched do not reveal the relic, the last one will automatically be the relic, there is no need to roll for
it.]

[Relic of Power: The relic is treated as a Light Object (see page 109 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual). However the dark powers that lie upon it may seep into the mind of its holder. Unwilling to give it up, models carrying the relic may not drop it or pass it to another model. Additionally, at the start of each turn, before Priority is rolled, roll a D6. On a 1, the model
is Transfixed as on page 98 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. Might may not be used to modify this
roll.]

[[]{#bookmark38 .anchor}Maelstrom of Battle: At the end of your Move

[Models wholly within 12" of the centre of the battlefield do not count as being in any quarter of the battlefield for working out Victory Points.]

[Maelstrom of Battle: At the end of your Move phase, roll a D6 for each of your warbands not on the battlefield and consult the chart below (the warband's captain can use Might to alter the roll either up or down). Models can't charge in the turn that they arrive but otherwise act normally. Roll for each warband separately, deploy the models in the warband, then roll for the next. Warbands yet to arrive count as being on the battlefield for the purposes of determining if your force is
Broken.]

RETRIEVAL]

[*Both forces have claimed something of value from their enemy, and both
will fight to reclaim what is rightfully
theirs.*]

[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[Reclaim what was stolen by the enemy and escape the battlefield with it.]

[THE ARMIES]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the corners of the board, and their opponent automatically has the opposite. A line is then drawn between the two chosen corners, and both players then place a single Objective marker 15" away from their corner along this line — this is their own
relic.]

[The board is then split into two halves diagonally between the two corners that were not chosen, forming two deployment zones. The player who scored the highest then selects a warband in their force to deploy in their deployment zone, but not within 3" of the line that runs diagonally through the centre of the board. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their warband.]

[When this has been done, the opposing player deploys one of their warbands in their deployment zone as described above. Players then alternate until all of their warbands have been
placed.]

[INITIAL PRIORITY]

[Both players roll a D6. The player with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.]

[OBJECTIVES]

[Once one force has been Broken, the game might suddenly end. At the end of each turn after this condition has been met, roll a D6. On a 1-2, the game ends — otherwise, the battle continues for another turn.]

[At the end of the game, the force that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both players have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.]

[SCORING VICTORY POINTS]

[* You score 1 Victory Point if your opponent's relic has moved from its original position at the end of the game. If you have retrieved your opponent's relic, you instead score 3 Victory Points. If you have retrieved your opponent's relic, and the model holding it is in your deployment zone, you instead score 5 Victory Points. If you have retrieved your opponent's relic, and managed to move it off the board via either of the board edges in your deployment zone, you instead
score]

[Victory Points.You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more
Wounds on the enemy leader (Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count). If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 2 Victory Points.You score 1 Victory Point if the enemy force is Broken
at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken, and your force is unbroken, you instead score 3 Victory Points.SPECIAL
RULES]

[The Relic: Each relic is a Light Object (see page 109 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual). A relic is considered to have been retrieved if at the end of the game it is being carried by a friendly model. If a relic has been picked up by an enemy model, and is then subsequently dropped or retaken by a friendly model, then a player must try to return it to its original position as quickly as possible. Until it has been picked up by an enemy model, friendly models may not pick up their own
relic.]

[SCENARIO 15 — BREAKTHROUGH]

[*With both forces locked in a battle for supremacy, both sides know
that if they can break through their enemy's lines they can seize a
valuable strategic point from their foe.*]

[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[Capture the areas of the battlefield that are worth the most to your opponent.]

[THE ARMIES]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. Then, place four Objective markers on the board. One of these is placed exactly 12" from the centre of one player's board edge, and another is placed exactly 12" from the centre of the other player's board edge. The remaining two Objectives are both placed 12" away from the centre of the board, on opposite sides, along the centreline of the board.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both players roll a D6 — the player with the highest result chooses one of the deployment zones. They then select a warband in their force to deploy within 24" of their board edge. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their
warband.]

[When this has been done, the opposing player chooses one of their warbands and deploys it within 24" of their board edge, as described above. Players then alternate until all of their warbands have been placed.]

[Supply Markers: The Objective markers represent a series of supplies that both sides are trying to destroy. To destroy an enemy supply marker, a model must be in base contact with the marker during the End phase of a turn having not cast any Magical Powers, used a missile weapon, been involved in a Fight, or been under the effects of the Paralyse, Immobilise or Transfix Magical Power during that turn. Once a supply marker has been destroyed, remove it from play.]
