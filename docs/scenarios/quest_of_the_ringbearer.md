CROP

F] [armer Maggot is a
well-respected member of the Shire community; a stubborn and practical fellow who devotes his time to the crops that he grows rather than to the other goings-on in the Shire. It is said that Maggot's crops are the best in all the four Farthings. His carrots are without peer, his cabbages tastier than any others, but it is his mushrooms that are the pride of Maggot's crop; envied across the Shire, especially as all Hobbits are rather fond of mushrooms.

As a direct result of having the best crops, Maggot's farm is often
subject to raids for his produce. Not the violent and aggressive raids that
happen in other reaches of Middle-earth, but instead the mischievous antics of youthful Hobbits who see pinching the odd batch of mushrooms as
a

thrilling rite of passage in the Shire. Certainly, these raids are not
the kind to cause a larger skirmish or fight, but should Farmer Maggot catch
those younger Hobbits in the act then he will not hesitate to administer a
swift thwack with his hands or set his dogs upon the intruders. Many has been the young Hobbit who has returned home empty handed and sporting the odd bruise and dog
bite.

As Frodo and Sam set out to Bree they wandered into one of Maggot's fields, and it just so happened to be the one that Merry and Pippin
were intent on raiding themselves. Upon joining up together, the Hobbits
decide to try to gather some extra provisions for themselves, however, should Maggot's dogs alert him to the actions of the Hobbits, then the farmer
will no doubt race out to protect his
crop.

(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image11.jpeg){width="2.5069444444444446in"
height="2.5034722222222223in"}

LAYOUT

The board represents the area of Maggot's farm immediately surrounding his house. Farmer Maggot's house should be placed 6" from the centre of the northern board edge, with his hounds' kennel within 6" of the house as shown on the map. A fenced field 4" long and 6" wide should be in the middle of the board, with a couple of exits to the field around the edges. A Stash Marker should be placed 12" from the centre of the southern board edge. The rest of the board should be dotted with a few hedges, trees and bushes.

STARTING POSITIONS

Grip, Fang and Wolf are deployed touching the
kennel.

Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin are then deployed within 3" of the Stash Marker. Farmer Maggot will be available
later.

OBJECTIVES

The Hobbits are out for quick and tasty plunder and are hoping to get it from Maggot's crop. Farmer Maggot, however, does not take kindly to those that steal from him and will do what he can to fend off any would be
thieves.

The 'Evil' side wins immediately if they can gather five Plunder Tokens at the Stash Marker. The Good side wins if all the Hobbits flee before this can
happen.

SPECIAL RULES

Definitely not Life or Death -- Hobbits are not naturally violent, and scrumping some crops is not worth losing life or limb over.
Likewise, while Maggot will guard his crop, he will never administer more than a well-deserved walloping to any
Hobbit.

In this Scenario, the Hobbits are wounded in a special way. Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin have 3 Wounds each, but no Might, Will or Fate. If one of the Hobbits suffers 3 Wounds, the amount of dog bites and bruises they have gathered is enough to make them flee -- remove them from the board. Frodo may not use the Ring in this Scenario.

Farmer Maggot -- Should Maggot hear his dogs barking, he will quickly go outside to see what the commotion is all
about.

If any dog suffers a Wound then Farmer Maggot has been alerted. At the end of each Good Move phase after this condition has been met, and after all other Good models have moved, roll a D6. On a 3+, Farmer Maggot is placed touching his house. Farmer Maggot may not Charge on the turn he arrives, but may otherwise act
normally.

The Farmer and his Hounds -- Whilst they may be stealing from him, the Hobbits do hold a high degree of respect (and fear) for Farmer Maggot and his dogs and will not seek to harm
them.

No Hobbit may make Strikes against Farmer Maggot or target him with stones. The Hobbits may also not make Special Strikes. Should a dog suffer a Wound, it will not be slain; instead it is removed from the board and placed touching the kennel. A dog sent to the kennel in this way may do nothing else unless Farmer Maggot touches the kennel, at which point the dog can act as normal. Additionally, Farmer Maggot and his dogs have the Terror special rule in this
Scenario.

Loot and Plunder -- The Hobbits are hoping to find carrots, cabbages, mushrooms and all manner of other good food in Maggot's
fields.

If, during the End phase of any turn, any of the Hobbits are within Maggot's field and did not fight or shoot that turn, they immediately gain a Plunder Token -- this is a Light
Object.

If a Hobbit carrying a Plunder Token is charged, or charges, it will immediately drop the token within 1" of itself. Hobbits may only carry one Plunder Token at a time, and may only voluntarily drop them when in base contact with the Stash
Marker.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Farmer
Maggot.

'Evil': Frodo Baggins; Samwise
Gamgee;

Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin
Took.

Whilst the Hobbits definitely are not Evil, the fact they are stealing crops from Farmer Maggot means they will play the role of the Evil force in this
Scenario.

Designer's notes: This Scenario can be played with five people if you wish. In this situation, one player plays as the Good force, and the
other players each control one of the Hobbits. When deploying the Hobbits, players will take it in turns to deploy their Hobbit anywhere at least
12" from the crop, and 6" from each other. When deployed, a Hobbit will
place their own Stash Marker that they will be trying to get Plunder Tokens
to. The first Hobbit to get three Plunder Tokens to their Stash Marker
wins. If all the Hobbits flee before this can happen then Farmer Maggot
wins.

[]{#bookmark15 .anchor}SHORT CUTS MAKE LONG
DELAYS

F] [rodo and his
companions have departed the
Shire;

unaware of the danger they are actually in. Merry has gone ahead to prepare Crickhollow and meet Frodo later on, leaving the others to make their way towards Buckleberry Ferry. As they walk the forest paths, the Hobbits encounter a rider in black and instinctively hide from it after feeling a sense of dread wash over
them.

Having evaded the mysterious Black Rider, the Hobbits continue on
their way through the woodlands of the Shire. Along one of the many forest paths, they encounter a group of Elves led by Gildor Inglorion. The
Elves provide the Hobbits with some much-needed rest, food and advice on the Black Riders they have encountered, before Frodo and his companions continue on their
way.

As the Hobbits leave the company of Gildor and the Elves and make
their way through the forest, they make sure to heed Gandalf's words and stay off the roads as much as
possible.

Yet even as night begins to fall, the Hobbits begin to feel fear once
more seeping in. They cannot shake the feeling of dread that the mysterious riders in black are not far away and constantly a threat to
them.

and his companions realise, constantly stalking the paths of the forest in their search for
the one who carries the Ring. Should the Nazgûls' search prove fruitful and
they find the Baggins that carries their master's prize, they will not
hesitate to kill him and take the Ring for
Sauron.

LAYOUT

The board represents a section of the wooded area in the Shire's Eastfarthing. The board should have plenty of trees and bushes dotted around it so as to give the impression of a densely wooded area, as well as provide plenty of places for the Hobbits to hide from the Ringwraiths. A hedge runs across the board from north to south 12" from the western board
edge.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Hobbits start in base contact with the hedge. Gildor is deployed touching the centre of the eastern board
edge.

One Ringwraith is then deployed touching the centre of each of the northern, southern and western board
edges.

OBJECTIVES

Frodo is being hunted by the Black Riders, and must slip past them so as to escape them. The Ringwraiths are hunting Frodo, and if they find him they will not hesitate to kill him and take the Ring.

SPECIAL RULES

The Search -- The Nazgûl have not found the Ringbearer, and are relentlessly searching for the
Ring.

The Ringwraiths follow the rules for Sentries as detailed in the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Rules Manual. Additionally, as the Ringwraiths are not well suited to seeing in daylight, all Good models gain the Stalk Unseen special rule. If Frodo puts the Ring on, the alarm is immediately raised and each Ringwraith will move up to 6" towards Frodo if
able.

Lost in the Woods -- The Hobbits are apprehensive after their run-in with the Black Riders and are now scared and lost in the
woods.

Until the alarm has been raised, at the start of each of the Hobbits' move they must take a Courage test. If they fail, the Evil player may move them instead. Once the alarm has been raised, the Hobbits are aware of the danger they are in and may act as normal.

Cry of the Nazgûl -- The piercing cry of the Nazgûl is enough to
freeze the hearts of all that hear
it.

Once per game, after the alarm has been raised, the Evil player can use this special rule. After Priority has been determined, the Evil player can unleash the screech of the Nazgûl. Until the end of the turn, all Good models reduce their Courage value by
3.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins; Samwise Gamgee; Peregrin
Took;

Gildor Inglorion.

Evil: 3 Ringwraiths with no additional Might, Will or
Fate.

The Good player wins if Frodo escapes the board via the eastern board edge, or if all the Ringwraiths are slain. The Evil player wins if Frodo is
slain.

[]{#bookmark17 .anchor}BUCKLEBERRY
FERRY

H] [aving once evaded
the Black Riders, and spent some time resting with Gildor and his Elves, the Hobbits find themselves back on their journey towards Crickhollow. Once more heeding Gandalf's words to stay off the road, the Hobbits are travelling through the densely wooded areas of Buckland just in case any more of these mysterious riders in black may yet be tracking
them.

As they near the Brandywine River, the Hobbits' fears are realised.
Ahead they are aware of some of the Black Riders hunting for them and fear
once more begins to creep into their minds. However, the Nazgûl have not yet noticed the presence of the Hobbits, and are searching the surrounding
area as they seek for whoever carries the Ring of
Power.

The Hobbits know they must escape the Black Riders and quickly, and
the only way to put some meaningful distance between them and their
pursuers is to cross the Brandywine river using the Buckleberry Ferry. However,
the Nazgûl stand between them and the relative safety of the ferry, so to
reach it the Hobbits will have to use every ounce of stealth, and no small
amount of luck, to make it to the ferry
undetected.

SPECIAL RULES

The Search -- The Nazgûl have not found the Ringbearer, and are relentlessly searching for the
Ring.

The Nazgûl follow the rules for Sentries as detailed in the Middle- earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. If Frodo puts the Ring on, the alarm is immediately raised and each Nazgûl will move up to 6" towards Frodo if
able.

The Ferry -- In order to cross the Brandywine, the Hobbits must use
the ferry to row to
safety.

The Ferry can be moved at a rate of D6" per turn, and must have at least one model on it to move. Models on the Ferry whilst it moves cannot then move themselves, unless as part of a Heroic Action or Magical Power. The Ferry cannot be moved as part of a Heroic Action.

The Brandywine -- The Hobbits are naturally fearful of water, but are more scared of the Nazgûl and will brave the river if
necessary.

LAYOUT

The board represents the Brandywine River and the surrounding area. The Brandywine runs from north to south 6" away from the eastern board edge and should be 6" wide. The Buckleberry Ferry should be in the centre of the western bank. The area of the board at least 18" from the eastern board edge should be densely packed with trees, hedges and
bushes.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Ringwraiths are deployed within 3" of the centreline of the board that runs from north to south. The Hobbits are then deployed anywhere between 6" and 12" from the western board edge.

OBJECTIVES

Frodo must not let the Ring fall into the Ringwraiths' hands, and must escape them using the Buckleberry Ferry to cross the
river.

The Good player wins if Frodo can escape the board via the eastern board edge. The Evil player wins if Frodo is
slain.

The Brandywine is Deep Water. Additionally, any Hobbit in the water must make a Courage test before rolling on the Swim chart. If the test is failed, the Hobbit must try to swim towards the nearest bank during that turn. The Nazgûl may not enter the water under any
circumstances.

Cry of the Nazgûl -- The piercing cry of the Nazgûl is enough to
freeze the hearts of all that hear
it.

Once per game, after the alarm has been raised, the Evil player can use this special rule. After Priority has been determined, the Evil player can unleash the screech of the Nazgûl. Until the end of the turn, all Good models reduce their Courage value by 3.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins; Samwise
Gamgee;

Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin
Took.

Evil: 3 Ringwraiths with no additional Might, Will or
Fate.

[]{#bookmark20 .anchor}THE OLD
FOREST

H] [aving evaded the
Black Riders for the time being, the Hobbits have reached Frodo's new home
of

Crickhollow. Stopping for the night to sleep, stock up on provisions, and above all, have a large well-earned meal, Frodo and his companions are in good spirits as they leave the comfort of Crickhollow in the hands of their friend Fredegar Bolger, and set off east once
more.

Upon their journey, the Hobbits decide to venture through the Old
Forest on the edge of Buckland, for the Black Riders will not be able to
traverse the thick undergrowth and so the Hobbits can potentially shake them off their tail. Yet there have long been tales about the Old Forest in
old Shire stories; some say that those who venture into it seldom return,
whilst others say that the trees themselves are full of danger and can come
alive. Regardless of what actually may be true, the Old Forest is a scary place
to walk, and no Hobbit would go there if they did not have
to.

(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image18.jpeg){width="5.5368055555555555in"
height="3.879861111111111in"}Yet the Hobbits push on anyway, for surely
whatever terrors the forest may hold cannot be worse than another encounter with the Black Riders. As they go deeper into the forest, the Hobbits get an uneasy feeling about
their surroundings, and soon have become lost in the shrouded gloom. Unsure of the way to go, the Hobbits can hear the sounds of snapping twigs and creaking boughs, and begin to realise that some of the old stories may
have more truth than they ever imagined... 

(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image19.jpeg){width="2.5034722222222223in"
height="2.5069444444444446in"}

LAYOUT

The board represents the Old Forest, and as such should be densely packed with trees and other woodland
terrain.

SPECIAL RULES

The Trees are Alive! -- It has long been said that the trees of the
Old Forest could come alive; something that the Hobbits are about to
discover.

At the start of each turn, the Evil player rolls a D6 to see how many of the trees are moving this turn. During the Evil player's Move phase, they may move a number of trees up to the number rolled at the start of the turn. Trees move D6" per turn, have no Control Zone, and use the following
profile:

Mv F S D A W C

6" 2/5+ 3 3 1 1 2

Trees that lose a fight can still be struck, but will not be slain if they suffer any Wounds. Instead, for each Wound a Tree suffers, it will Back Away 1" from its attackers (if
able).

Knocked Unconscious -- The trees are not actually trying to kill the Hobbits, rather they are trying to drive them from their
lands.

Any Hobbit that suffers its last Wound and would be slain will be knocked unconscious rather than being removed as a casualty. Treat the model as being under the effects of the Paralyse Magical
Power.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins; Samwise
Gamgee;

Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin
Took.

Evil: None. No,
really!

STARTING POSITIONS

The Hobbits deploy touching the western board edge as close to the centre as
possible.

OBJECTIVES

The trees of the Old Forest have started to awaken; the Hobbits must try to make their way through the forest safely without falling into the traps of these malicious
trees.

The Good player wins if all four Hobbits can escape the board via the eastern board edge in the same turn. The Evil player wins if at the end of any turn all four of the Hobbits are
unconscious.

[]{#bookmark23 .anchor}FOG ON THE
BARROW-DOWNS

F] [ollowing their
ordeal within the Old Forest, the Hobbits have been rescued by the jolly Tom
Bombadil.

Having freed the Hobbits from the clutches of Old Man Willow, Tom has led them to his home to meet his wife, Goldberry, eat and sing merrily to raise their spirits, before sending them off to bed to get a good long
rest.

Waking refreshed and in as high spirits as they have ever been, Frodo
and his companions head away from the homestead of Tom Bombadil filled with good food and a merry heart, setting out once more. Continuing
along the forest paths they come to a clearing, one with a series of strange
looking mounds around it. As they venture forth, fog quickly descends upon the clearing reducing visibility to mere
feet.

From within the barrows, long-dead beings drift into the clearing; the spirits of forgotten kings and noblemen of old. These dread
Barrow-wights have come forth from their barrows to claim a sacrifice in order to
perform an ancient ritual, and the Hobbits who are completely unaware of their spectral presence are seemingly easy
targets.

(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image21.jpeg){width="5.176388888888889in"
height="3.4in"}Lost within the fog that has descended upon the
Barrow-downs, the Hobbits must try to find their way through the fog for safety. If Frodo
and his companions quickly realise the danger they are in, they will need to
call to Tom Bombadil and Goldberry for help once more, yet should they
realise too late the severity of the peril they are in, they may well soon rest
with the spirits of the dead within the
barrows.

(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image22.jpeg){width="2.5034722222222223in"
height="2.4034722222222222in"}

LAYOUT

The board represents the Barrow-downs, and as such should have four barrows each one 12" from the corner of a different board edge. The western board edge should be dotted with trees representing the edge of the Old Forest, and the rest of the board should have the odd rock or bush dotted
around.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Hobbits deploy anywhere between 12" and 24" of the western board edge. Each Barrow-wight then deploys touching a different barrow.

OBJECTIVES

Lost in the swirling mists, the Hobbits are aware that something is not right. They must try to escape the clearing before whatever evil lurks in the fog can reach
them.

The game lasts until one side completes their
objective.

The Good side wins if three Hobbits, including Frodo, move off the board via the eastern board edge. The Evil side wins if they can sacrifice any two Hobbits. Additionally, if Frodo is sacrificed then the Evil side
wins.

SPECIAL RULES

The Barrow -- These ancient burial sites are the key to the strange powers the Barrow-wights still
hold.

Whilst within 3" of a Barrow, a Barrow-wight may spend a single point of Will each turn without reducing their store of
Will.

Fog on the Barrow-downs -- The mists that have descended on the Barrow-downs make it hard for the Hobbits to see and they are likely to get lost.

Hobbit models can only see up to 6". Additionally, whilst the fog remains on the board, before each Hobbit model moves, roll a D6. On a 2+ the Good player may move them as normal. On a 1, the Evil player will move them instead, though they cannot make them Charge an enemy model. Might may not be used to influence this roll.

Ho! Tom Bombadil! -- When the Hobbits realise the seriousness of the danger they are in, they will not hesitate to call for Tom Bombadil to assist them.

During each Hobbit model's Move phase, if that Hobbit has seen a Barrow-wight, they may call for Tom Bombadil; even if they are in combat. Whenever a Hobbit calls for Tom, roll a D6. On a 5+, Tom Bombadil will enter the board from the western board edge at the start of the next Good Move phase. As soon as Tom Bombadil enters the board, the fog lifts. At the end of each turn after Tom has arrived, roll a D6. On the roll of a natural 6, Goldberry enters the board in the same manner as
Tom.

Sacrifice -- The Barrow-wights are not trying to simply just kill the Hobbits, instead they are intending to use them as a sacrifice to
perform some ancient ritual
with.

Any Hobbit that suffers its last Wound and would be slain will instead be paralysed rather than being removed as a casualty. Treat the model as being under the effects of the Paralyse Magical Power. A Barrow-wight may drag a paralysed Hobbit at full speed, but will immediately drop them if Charged. Should a Hobbit recover from paralysis whilst being dragged, the Good player may place them within 1" of where they were. Should a Barrow-wight start its move in base contact with both a Barrow and a paralysed Hobbit, they can attempt to sacrifice them. Roll a D6, on a 4+ the Hobbit has been sacrificed and removed as a casualty. The Barrow-wight may then act as
normal.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins; Samwise
Gamgee;

Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin
Took;

Tom Bombadil;
Goldberry.

Evil: 4
Barrow-wights.

[]{#bookmark26 .anchor}NAZGÛL IN
BREE

H] [aving made their
way out of the Old Forest, the Hobbits find themselves at the gates to the village of Bree where they are questioned by the aging gatekeeper, Harry Goatleaf. Convincing Harry to let them pass, Frodo and his companions make straight for the inn at the Prancing Pony where Gandalf has said he will be waiting for them.

However, upon entering the inn and talking to the kindly landlord, Barliman Butterbur, the Hobbits discover that Gandalf is not there and they have no idea what to do next. Deciding to rest, eat and sample
some of the ales the Pony has to offer, the Hobbits enjoy the warmth and
comfort of the inn; until the raucous goings-on of Pippin cause Frodo to fall
and the Ring to slip onto his finger, making him disappear in front of the very
eyes of the other guests.

Such an act caused much discussion among the residents of Bree, but none was more drawn to Frodo's accident than the strange hooded figure that had been sitting in the corner of the inn watching the Hobbits. Fortunately, the Ranger revealed himself to be a friend of Gandalf, something backed up by a letter left at the Prancing Pony for
Frodo.

height="3.5236111111111112in"}However, this mysterious Ranger, going by
the name of Strider, is more than he seems at first. Strider is aware of the dread truth of what now stalks Frodo and his companions, and that the Hobbits are not nearly as frightened as perhaps they should be. If Frodo is to avoid the clutches of the Ringwraiths, he must trust in Strider who himself must get the Hobbits out of Bree before the Nazgûl can find them. 

(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image24.jpeg){width="2.5in"
height="2.5034722222222223in"}

LAYOUT

The board represents the village of Bree. Along the western board edge runs the walls of the village, with the gates in the centre of the western board edge and a wall 12" from the gates. In the centre of the board are the doors to the Prancing Pony facing towards the western board edge. The rest of the board should have plenty of buildings, walls and other things you may find around the village.

STARTING POSITIONS

Aragorn, the Hobbits and Barliman start the game inside the Prancing Pony, and so do not start on the
board.

Harry Goatleaf is deployed 3" from the centre of the western board edge. The Ringwraiths will enter the board during the first turn.

OBJECTIVES

The Nazgûl's hunt for the Ring has brought them to Bree, and they will tear the village apart to find it. Frodo must escape Bree if he is to prevent the Ring falling into the hands of the Ringwraiths.

The Good side wins if Frodo, Aragorn and at least two other Hobbit models escape the board via the eastern board edge. The Evil side wins if Frodo is
slain.

SPECIAL RULES

Move Quietly -- Aragorn and the Hobbits must move quietly without drawing attention to themselves if they are to remain hidden from the Ringwraiths.

Good models may not declare a Heroic March in this Scenario. The Good models within the Prancing Pony exit the inn via the door during the Good player's first Move
phase.

Hunting the Ringbearer -- Whilst the Nazgûl know the Ring is in Bree, they do not know its exact
location.

The Ringwraiths enter the board at the start of the Evil player's first Move phase via the gates; they may Charge on the turn they arrive. From the second turn onwards, roll a D6 for each Ringwraith before they move. On a 1-3, the Evil player moves that Ringwraith and on a 4+ the Good player moves that Ringwraith. This condition ends immediately if the Heroes have been spotted.

Spotting the Heroes -- The Nazgûl are scouring the streets of Bree in search of the
Ringbearer.

If, after both sides have moved, a Ringwraith can draw Line of Sight to a Good model within 12" (with the exception of Harry Goatleaf) then the Heroes have been spotted. If the Line of Sight is obscured, the Ringwraith must roll a D6 to determine if they can see the model. On a 5+, that model has been seen and the Heroes have been
spotted.

Lure of the Ring -- The Ring wants to be found and, knowing that the Nazgûl are close, it will try to tempt Frodo to put it
on.

Before Frodo tries to move, he must make a Courage
test.

If he passes, everything is fine; however, if he fails, he must put the Ring on. Frodo suffers an additional -1 to this Courage test for each Ringwraith within 12" after the first. Frodo gains a bonus of +1 to this test for each friendly model in base contact. If Frodo puts the Ring on, the Heroes immediately count as being spotted and each Ringwraith may immediately move towards Frodo if
able.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins; Samwise
Gamgee;

Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin Took; Aragorn --
Strider;

Barliman Butterbur; Harry
Goatleaf.

Evil: 4 Ringwraiths on horse with no
additional

Might, Will or
Fate.

[]{#bookmark29
.anchor}WEATHERTOP

A] [fter fleeing the
Black Riders in Bree, the Hobbits have had to put their faith in the mysterious traveller known as Strider who aided their escape. With Gandalf not having been at the Prancing Pony, the Hobbits must now follow Strider to Rivendell in order to keep the Ring safe and prevent the Black Riders from finding them and reclaiming the Ring for the Dark
Lord.

As they continue to walk eastwards across country, Aragorn and the Hobbits stop to rest within the old ruined watchtower of Amon Sûl. This former seat of power once held one of the Palantíri in the times
of Elendil, though many years of war and ruin have seen it abandoned and in disrepair. Weathertop, as it is now known, would make an ideal place to set up camp away from prying eyes, and whilst the Hobbits rest,
Strider goes off to forage for
food.

Yet, Strider has been away for some time scouting the lands around Weathertop, and Hobbits never were ones to go without food for too long if they can help it. In the depths of night, the Hobbits' hunger
provokes them to start a small fire in the hope of cooking a quick meal of
tomatoes, sausages and some nice crispy bacon as a means to fill them up and
prevent their stomachs from constantly
rumbling.

height="3.7569444444444446in"}However, their innocent endeavour has had
some dire consequences and has given away their location to the pursuing Ringwraiths, who now head straight towards the ruins of the watchtower of Amon Sûl. Huddled together within the centre of Weathertop, the terrified Hobbits are
faced with the shrouded figures of the Nazgûl, and the terrible fate that
awaits them if Strider cannot reach them in time...

LAYOUT

The board represents the ruined watchtower of Amon Sûl, which has a diameter of 12" and should occupy the centre of the board. The rest of the board can have the odd pile of rubble, trees and hedges dotted
around.

STARTING POSITIONS

Frodo is deployed in the centre of Weathertop, with the other Hobbits surrounding him. The Ringwraiths are then deployed touching the edge of Amon Sûl. Aragorn is not deployed on the board at the start of the
game.

OBJECTIVES

The Nazgûl have come to claim the Ring for their master; only by driving them off can Frodo and his companions hope to keep the Ring.

SPECIAL RULES

Flaming Brands -- With the Nazgûl having arrived, the Hobbits have picked up flaming brands to protect
themselves.

Aragorn, Merry, Pippin and Sam have flaming brands in addition to their normal weapons. If a Ringwraith loses a Duel roll against a model with a flaming brand, they will retreat D6" directly away from that model. Additionally, Aragorn may choose to use his flaming brand as a throwing weapon. If it hits, do not roll To Wound; instead the model is immediately Set
Ablaze.

Once Aragorn has thrown his flaming brand, he may not use it for the remainder of the
Scenario.

Aragorn -- Aragorn has been scouting ahead and foraging for food, only by hearing the cries of the Hobbits will he know to return to protect
them.

From the second turn onwards, roll a D6 at the end of each Good Move phase. On a 4+, Aragorn has arrived; place him in base contact with any edge of Amon Sûl. Aragorn may not Charge, but may otherwise act
normally.

Cry of the Nazgûl -- The piercing cry of the Nazgûl is enough to
freeze the hearts of all that hear
it.

Once per game the Evil player may use this special
rule.

Until the end of the turn, all Good models reduce their Courage value by 3. If this is used before Aragorn has arrived then Aragorn will automatically arrive the next
turn.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins; Samwise
Gamgee;

Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin Took; Aragorn --
Strider.

Evil: The Witch-king of Angmar with Morgul
Blade;

4 Ringwraiths, each with no additional Might, Will or
Fate.

The Evil side wins if Frodo is slain; the Good side wins if all of the Ringwraiths are slain before this can
happen.

[]{#bookmark32 .anchor}FLIGHT TO THE
FORD

H] [aving suffered a
wound from a Morgul Blade at the hands of the Witch-king atop Amon Sûl, Frodo is slowly passing into the shadow world and turning into a wraith himself. In an attempt to save Frodo, Aragorn and the Hobbits search for the Athelas plant, a weed that could help slow the poison enough to get Frodo to Rivendell and the aid he needs.

It is as he searches for the Athelas that Aragorn encounters Arwen,
the daughter of Elrond of Rivendell who had been sent to search for the Hobbits. Seeing the danger that Frodo is in, and needing to get him quickly to her father, Arwen loads Frodo onto the back of her steed, Asfaloth, and makes haste for Rivendell. However, the Black Riders are still out in the wilderness and will hunt down the Ringbearer at all
costs.

(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image28.jpeg){width="5.166666666666667in"
height="3.3965277777777776in"}As she makes for Rivendell, Arwen becomes
aware of the Nazgûl closing in upon her in their attempt to claim the Ring. Arwen must ride swiftly to evade the Ringwraiths and reach the River Bruinen; for once there the powers of her father can unleash the force of the river upon their pursuers, and allow Frodo to reach Rivendell and the Elvish medicine he desperately needs.

(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image29.jpeg){width="2.5034722222222223in"
height="2.5034722222222223in"}

LAYOUT

The board represents the River Bruinen and the surrounding area. The river should be 6" wide and 6" from the eastern board edge. In the centre of the river is the ford which should be 6" wide. The rest of the board should be dotted with trees, hedges and other such
undergrowth.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys Arwen within 6" of the western board edge. Frodo starts as a Passenger on Asfaloth. The Evil player then deploys the Witch-king and any four Ringwraiths within 6" of the western board edge, but not within 1" of Arwen. The remaining Good models enter the board via the western board edge during the first turn. The remaining Ringwraiths will be available as the game goes on.

OBJECTIVES

Frodo must reach the safety of Rivendell before the wound suffered by the Morgul Blade corrupts him, but cannot do so with the Ringwraiths so near. The Ringwraiths must slay the Hobbit and reclaim the
Ring.

The Good player wins if all nine Ringwraiths are
slain.

The Evil player wins if Frodo is slain. If both players achieve their objective in the same turn, the game is a
draw.

SPECIAL RULES

Protection of Imladris -- Once they have crossed the Bruinen, Arwen and Frodo will be under the protection of Rivendell against any unsavoury powers.

Good models that are on the eastern side of the river count as having the Fortify Spirit Magical Power cast upon them, even if their Will points are reduced to
0.

Weakened by the Chase -- The encounter at Amon Sûl, and subsequent chase, has left both the Hobbits and the Ringwraiths weary and exhausted.

Frodo, Sam and Aragorn start the game with no Might points in their store; Frodo also starts the game with no Fate due to the wounds of the Morgul Blade. The Ringwraiths start the game with only 3 Will points each, whilst the Witch-king starts with 5 Will points. Additionally, the Ringwraiths' horses are exhausted and so will move D6+4" each turn. However, if a 6 is rolled for their movement, after they have moved the horse will collapse from exhaustion and the rider must take a Thrown Rider
test.

The Wrath of Bruinen -- Elrond can manipulate the Bruinen by a command, thrusting its full force at those within the
river.

At the start of the game, the river is treated as Deep Water and the ford is open ground; however, Cavalry models may only move at half speed over the ford. Once Asfaloth has stepped foot in the river, the Good player may roll a D6 at the start of each following turn. On a 4+ Elrond is ready to unleash the power of the Bruinen, which the Good player can release at any point in any following Good Move phase. When the Bruinen is unleashed, all models in the river (Good and Evil) are removed from the game as casualties. From that point on, the river is treated as impassible terrain and the ford is treated as difficult terrain. Arwen may not use the Wrath of Bruinen Magical Power in this
Scenario.

The Ringwraiths -- Several of the Ringwraiths have split off from the main group to try to outflank their
quarry.

From the second turn onwards, roll a D6 for each Ringwraith that has not yet arrived. On a 4+ they may enter the board from any point on the northern or southern board edges via the rules for Reinforcements. However, they may not enter the board east of, or in, the Bruinen. If a Ringwraith rolls a 1 to arrive, it has suffered an accident on its journey and is instead removed as a
casualty.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins; Samwise
Gamgee;

Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin Took; Aragorn -- Strider; Arwen Undómiel on
Asfaloth.

Evil: The Witch-king of Angmar on horse, and 8 Ringwraiths on horse, each with no additional Might, Will or
Fate.

Designer's Notes: If you wish you can play this Scenario with Glorfindel instead of Arwen. In this situation, Frodo is mounted on Asfaloth, even though he would not normally be able to do so, and is deployed as Arwen would normally be. Glorfindel will enter the board in the same manner as Aragorn and the
Hobbits.

[]{#bookmark35 .anchor}THE PASS OF
CARADHRAS

H] [aving delivered
the Ring to Rivendell, and had time to rest and recover from the wound he suffered
at

Weathertop, Frodo is summoned to the Council of Elrond along with representatives of all the races of the free peoples of Middle-earth. Elrond has called the Council to discuss what to do with the Ring now it is in their possession. After much deliberation, it is decided that the Ring must be destroyed by taking it to Mordor, and it is Frodo who volunteers as
Ringbearer.

As the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, they must find a way to
reach the other side of the Misty Mountains. Whilst Gimli argues they should take the Mines of Moria, and Boromir says they should make for the Gap of Rohan, Gandalf decides to lead the Fellowship over the mountain pass of Caradhras. However, Saruman has become wise to the Fellowship's plans and now plots to use his powers to bring the mountain down upon them as they try to cross
Caradhras.

Yet it is not just Frodo that sets out for Mordor; he is accompanied
by members of all the free peoples, who have formed the Fellowship of the Ring and sworn to protect Frodo and the Ring on the journey to Mordor. Strider and Gandalf have joined Frodo, as well as Gimli, Legolas and Boromir who represent the races of Dwarves, Elves and Men. Not wanting to leave their friend behind, Sam, Merry and Pippin have also chosen to
go with Frodo, though they know not the dangers that lie before
them.

SET-UP

For this mini-game you will need a pack of ordinary playing cards. Separate the cards into suits; shuffle the hearts and diamonds together and deal them face-down as shown above -- this is the pass of Caradhras. Give the spades and clubs to the Evil player, which makes up their
hand.

GAME TURN

At the beginning of each turn, the Evil player places one card from their hand face-down -- this is where Saruman is trying to bring down the mountain. The Good player then moves each member of the Fellowship to another card in any direction. Members of the Fellowship each move one space, except Legolas who may move two.

The Evil player then reveals their card. Any member of the Fellowship on a card with the same number as the one played, including picture cards, suffers a Wound; the card is then discarded. The Hobbits have two Wounds each; all other members of the Fellowship have three Wounds. Once a model is reduced to zero Wounds, they have been buried in the snow and are removed from the
game.

The turn then ends and the next turn
begins.

EXTRA RULES

At the end of each turn, the Evil player can play a card from their hand to bring down more of the mountain. The Evil player may choose a card in the playing area that matches the number they played, including picture cards, that has no models currently on it. That card is then buried and models cannot move over it. Cards in the eastern-most column cannot be chosen. Only one card per column may be buried in this
manner.

Evil: None!

OBJECTIVES

The Fellowship are trying to cross the Misty Mountains on the way to Mordor. However, Saruman plans to bring down the mountain on top of
them.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Fellowship will move onto any card on the western edge on the first turn.

The Good player wins if they can move any five members of the Fellowship off the board via the eastern edge. The Evil player wins if any five members of the Fellowship are
buried.

[]{#bookmark38 .anchor}WARGS IN THE
NIGHT

T] [he pass of
Caradhras has defeated the
Fellowship;

the biting weather having been provoked by the voice of Saruman making it all but impossible to cross the mountain without risking the lives of all the Fellowship. Forced back down the mountain, the Fellowship must decide on an alternative route that will lead them to the other side of the Misty
Mountains.

As the Fellowship make camp, the sound of howls can be heard breaking the quiet that had descended as night fell. Jumping to their feet, the Fellowship are soon surrounded by ravenous Wargs who seem intent on feasting upon each of them. Whether driven to attack by hunger or a
more sinister force is irrelevant as the Fellowship must fight off the
oncoming Warg pack in order to survive and reach the walls of
Moria.

Soon a debate breaks out amongst the Fellowship, with Boromir saying that they should make for the Gap of Rohan, whilst Gimli
proposes that they should go through the Mines of Moria. With the Gap of Rohan taking them too close to Isengard it is, reluctantly, decided that they
will go through the Mines of Moria, and Gandalf begins to lead the
Fellowship south towards the Dwarven
gates.

SPECIAL RULES

Fending off the Pack -- The Wargs are hungry, but if the Fellowship can fight enough of them off, they will turn tail and
flee.

From turn 11 onwards, if Priority is ever drawn then the game immediately ends.

Never-ending Pack -- There is a seemingly unending number of Wargs attacking the Fellowship, and more seem to keep
coming.

At the start of each turn, any Evil Warrior models that have previously been slain may enter the board at the end of the Evil Move phase via the rules for Reinforcements, from a board edge chosen by the player with Priority. A different board edge may be chosen for each
Warg.

Fearless -- The Wargs are ravenous and nothing will deter them from advancing upon their
prey.

All Evil models gain the Fearless special
rule.

LAYOUT

The board represents the lands at the base of the Misty Mountains. As such it should be dotted with a selection of varied terrain such as trees, rocks and
hills.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their models within 3" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then deploys the Warg chieftain touching the centre of any board edge. They then deploy six Wild Wargs touching each of the northern, eastern and western board edges.

OBJECTIVES

The Wargs are hungry and have attacked the Fellowship in search of a fresh kill. The Fellowship must fend them off for long enough to make the pack
retreat.

The Evil side wins if they can slay any five members of the Fellowship. The Good player wins if the game ends before this can happen. If Frodo dies then the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

[]{#bookmark41 .anchor}THE GATES OF
MORIA

A] [fter surviving
the attack from the Wargs, the Fellowship finally makes it to the walls of
Moria.

Upon the shores of the dark and sinister pool that is before the walls, the moon's light reveals the doors of Durin before the Fellowship. Using every spell and password he can remember, Gandalf tries to open the entrance, but to no avail. The Fellowship stands at the edge of Moria as Gandalf tries to remember the secrets to entering the mountain.

The wait is long, and soon some members of the Fellowship start to get bored. Merry and Pippin begin to see who can throw stones furthest into the pool, before being stopped by Aragorn telling them not to disturb
the water. After what feels like an eternity, it is Frodo that manages to
jog Gandalf's memory, realising that the text upon the doors of Durin is a riddle and solving it
himself.

As Gandalf speaks the Elvish word for friend, the doors creak open revealing the truth about what happened within Moria. No more is it the grand halls of Durin's folk and a great kingdom steeped in history and grandeur, but rather a tomb for countless Dwarves who perished at the hands of Goblin hordes. Deciding to make for the Gap of Rohan instead, the Fellowship turns back outside. Yet as they do, Frodo is grasped by
a long, slimy tentacle as the Watcher in the Water reveals
itself.

SPECIAL RULES

Caught by Surprise -- The Watcher in the Water has caught the Fellowship off-guard as it tries to find its next
meal.

The Evil player has Priority on the first turn. Additionally, Good models cannot use Magical Powers, or declare a Heroic Move or Heroic Shoot during the first
turn.

It won't Die! -- The Watcher is a huge creature determined to eat anything it can latch onto, it will keep unleashing its tentacles at
the Fellowship until they can escape, though it will retreat slightly if
wounded.

Whenever the Watcher in the Water suffers a Wound, it will immediately retreat D3" away from the model that wounded it in a direction chosen by its controlling player. Wounds caused in the Shoot phase whilst the Watcher in the Water is in combat will force the Watcher in the Water to leave combat. Additionally, the Watcher in the Water cannot be slain in this Scenario; whenever it would suffer its final wound it will instead retreat D6" away from the model that wounded it in a direction chosen by its controlling player.

The board represents the walls outside Moria and the pool that contains the Watcher in the Water. The walls of Moria run along the eastern board edge, with the gates in the centre of the eastern board edge. The south-western corner of the board is the Watcher's pool. The rest of the board should have the odd tree and pile of rocks dotted
around.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Evil player deploys the Watcher in the Water within 6" of the south-western corner of the board. The Good player
then

deploys Frodo anywhere touching the pool. The other
Hobbits

are deployed 6" away from Frodo, but not within the pool.
The

remaining Good models are deployed touching the gate to
Moria.

The Shallows -- The Watcher has attacked the Fellowship in the shallows of its pool, and its writhing and splashing makes it difficult to
traverse.

The Pool is shallow water. However, each time a Good model starts its Move within the Pool, they must roll a D6. On a 1, the model is knocked Prone and cannot move any further that turn. On a 2-5, the model counts as moving through difficult terrain. On a 6, the model may move as normal. Legolas gains a bonus of +1 to this roll. Additionally, as the water is
too

shallow, the Watcher in the Water may not use its Dragged to
the

Depths special
rule.

The game lasts until one force achieves their objective. The Good player wins if at least five members of the Fellowship escape the board via the gates to Moria, including Frodo. The Evil player wins if five or more Good models are slain. Additionally, if Frodo is slain, the Evil player automatically
wins.

Evil: The Watcher in the
Water.

OBJECTIVES

The Fellowship must escape the clutches of the Watcher in the Water by entering the Mines of Moria. The Watcher is simply after its next meal and will attempt to devour any members of the Fellowship it can get its tentacles
on.

PARTICIPANTS

[]{#bookmark44 .anchor}BALIN'S
TOMB

D] [riven into the
mines by their close encounter with the Watcher in the Water, the Fellowship now only
have

one choice in front of them; to venture forwards into
the

long dark of Moria in order to reach the other side of the mountains. The Fellowship must trust in Gandalf to lead them through the gloom, and all about them they can see the ruins of the once proud Dwarven realm, yet they find no signs of the expedition led by Balin that had sought to reclaim Moria many years
ago.

Within the chamber, Gandalf finds the Book of Mazarbul documenting the expedition of Balin and his subsequent fall. As Gandalf reads,
Pippin's inquisitiveness gets the better of him, knocking a skeleton down the
well and causing a great racket. Though at first nothing seems to come of it,
the Fellowship can soon hear the sounds of drums in the deep and the
scuttling of Goblins. They will have to fight their way out of the tomb if they
are to avoid the same fate as Balin and his
kin.

After a day's travel, the Fellowship leave the mines and enter the once
great Dwarven city of Dwarrowdelf. Though it is silent and cast into
darkness, the former grandeur of the place is still apparent. As they cross the
city, Gimli notices light coming from a small room and races to it in the
hope of finding his kin. However, all that is discovered is the tomb of Balin
and the remains of a battle held within the tomb long
ago.

LAYOUT

The board represents Balin's Tomb. In the centre of the southern board edge is the doorway to the tomb. There is a raised edge that runs all the way around the board that is 3" wide. In the centre of the board is the tomb itself, and the well is placed 9" from the centre of the northern board edge. A selection of pillars should be placed as shown on the map, as well as two trapdoors on the raised area in the centre of the eastern and western board
edges.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player places the Fellowship within 6" of the centre of the board. The Evil player then places the Goblins within 6" of the doorway to the tomb. The Cave Troll will be available later
on.

OBJECTIVES

The Fellowship have been ambushed by Goblins, and must now fight them off to
survive.

SPECIAL RULES

The Goblin Tide -- Quite how many Goblins have swarmed the tomb is unknown, and more constantly find their way to the
battle.

During the end of each of the Evil player's Move phases, any Goblin Warrior models that were previously slain may re-enter the board from one of the entry points on the board. Up to one Goblin may enter the board from each trapdoor (so long as no Good model is stood upon it), up to two Goblin models may enter from the well, and any others may enter via the doorway. Any Goblin models that cannot enter the board may try again next turn. Models that arrive in this manner may Charge on the turn they
arrive.

They have a Cave Troll! -- It is not just hordes of Goblins that have attacked the Fellowship, but also a fearsome Cave Troll that has been led into battle.

During the Evil player's fourth Move phase, the Cave Troll may enter the board from the doorway, and may Charge the turn it arrives. During the turn it enters the board, the Cave Troll may move 'through' friendly Goblin models. Any Goblin model moved through in this manner suffers a Strength 3 hit, and any Goblin model that the Cave Troll finishes its move on is automatically slain.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins with Sting and Mithril Coat; Samwise Gamgee; Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin
Took;

Evil: 2 Moria Goblin Captains; 24 Moria
Goblins:

8 with shield, 8 with spear, 8 with Orc bow; 1 Cave Troll with two-handed hammer and Troll
chain.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good player wins if at least five members of the Fellowship, including Frodo, are still alive when the game ends. The Evil player wins if five or more Good models are slain. Additionally, if Frodo is slain, the Evil player automatically wins.

[]{#bookmark47 .anchor}ESCAPE FROM
DWARROWDELF

A] [fter a desperate
battle in the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship have managed to escape somehow unscathed and made their way back into the city of Dwarrowdelf. It is here, within the ruined halls of this once great Dwarven city, that the Moria Goblins and Cave Trolls have pursued them until the Fellowship are completely surrounded and seemingly
trapped.

Yet to reach the bridge, the Fellowship must navigate the crumbling walkways of Dwarrowdelf, and must do so quickly before the Balrog can catch up to them. However, it is not just the Balrog that now pursues them, for the Goblins have once again given chase. Faced with Goblins
in front of them, and the threat of the Balrog behind them, the Fellowship must fight their way across Dwarrowdelf in order to reach the bridge
and the possibility of
safety.

With no way to escape, the Fellowship prepares themselves for their
final stand, however, from deep inside the mountain comes a terrifying sound; one that has not been heard by any of the free-folk of Middle-earth for thousands of years. From within the bowels of Moria comes a Balrog of Morgoth, a demon of the ancient world, and with its arrival the Goblins temporarily scatter. Knowing that such a foe is beyond any of them, Gandalf instructs the Fellowship to flee and make for the Bridge of Khazad-dûm.

LAYOUT

The board represents the raised walkways of Dwarrowdelf. The walkways should stretch from the east to west side of the board as shown on the map, and each walkway should be 12" long and 2" wide. The walkways descend from the western to the eastern board edge. The exact layout of the walkways is given on the map above.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their models on the walkways and within 6" of the western board edge. The Evil player doesn't deploy any models; they will be available as the game goes
on.

SPECIAL RULES

Goblin Pursuit -- The Fellowship are not being pursued solely by the Balrog, but also the teeming hordes of Moria
Goblins.

At the end of each Evil Move phase, the Evil player rolls a D6 to determine how many Goblins have caught up with the Fellowship: the Goblin Captains count as three Goblins each, and the Cave Troll counts as five Goblins. They then select Goblins from those not in play and roll a further D6. On a 1, the chosen models move on from the western board edge. On a 2-5 the Goblins move on from the eastern board edge. On a 6, the Evil player may select any walkway that doesn't have any Good models on it and deploys the Goblins on that
walkway.

Unstable Realm -- The walkways are old and the commotion upon them may cause parts of them to give
way.

Any model that leaves the walkways for any reason (except when a Good model escapes the board) will automatically be slain as they fall into the depths of Moria. Additionally, if the roll for Priority is ever tied then the Evil player may place a Chasm Marker on one of the walkways. Chasm Markers should stretch across a walkway and be 1" wide. These can be jumped as normal, but any model that rolls a 1 will fall into the depths of Moria and be slain. Chasm Markers cannot be placed on models, or within 3" of another Chasm
Marker.

OBJECTIVES

The Fellowship are trying to flee Moria and escape the pursuing Goblins who are trying to kill
them.

The game lasts until one force achieves their
objective.

The Good player wins if at least five members of the Fellowship escape the board via the eastern board edge, including
Frodo.

The Evil player wins if five or more Good models are slain. Additionally, if Frodo is slain, the Evil player automatically
wins.

[]{#bookmark51 .anchor}THE BRIDGE OF
KHAZAD-DÛM

H] [aving crossed the
walkways of Dwarrowdelf, the Bridge of Khazad-dûm is now in sight. This
slender

bridge once served as the heart of the eastern defences
of

Moria, and now it looks to be the Fellowship's salvation
if

they can cross it. With no enemies in front of them, Gandalf urges his companions forward and towards the bridge, for crossing it will lead them out of the Misty
Mountains.

With the approaching Balrog shaking the halls, Gandalf knows that the only way to save his companions is to destroy the Bridge of Khazad-dûm once they are all safely across. However, he will need to summon all of
his might to be able to crack the bridge and send it crumbling into the
abyss. If Gandalf can destroy the bridge before the Balrog can reach it then
they may all yet escape. If not then only an act of great sacrifice can hope
to save the
Fellowship...

Yet as they make haste towards the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, the
Fellowship can still hear the thunderous footsteps of the Balrog behind them, and
the scuttling of the Moria Goblins from either side. As they near the
bridge, the Fellowship can see the Goblins closing in, which may slow them down just enough to be at the mercy of the
Balrog.

LAYOUT

The board represents the Bridge of Khazad-dûm and the surrounding area. There is a chasm 6" wide running from north to south 6" away from the eastern board edge; the Bridge of Khazad-dûm crosses this chasm and should be 2" wide. The stairs to the exit are in the south-eastern board edge. The rest of the board should have the odd rock pile or pillar dotted
around.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys their models between 6" and 12" from the western board edge, and at least 18" from both the northern and southern board edges. The Evil player then splits the Goblins into two equal halves and deploys one half within 12" of the northern board edge, and the other half within 12" of the southern board edge. No Goblins may be deployed east of the chasm.

OBJECTIVES

The Fellowship must escape Moria and Gandalf must destroy the Bridge of Khazad-dûm in order to prevent any of the Goblins from pursuing them.

The game lasts until one force achieves their objective. The Good player wins if at least five members of the Fellowship escape the board via the stairs, including Frodo, and the Bridge of Khazad- dûm has been destroyed. The Evil player wins if five or more Good models are slain, or if the bridge has not been destroyed. Additionally, if Frodo is slain, the Evil player automatically
wins.

SPECIAL RULES

The Balrog -- The Balrog is pursuing the Fellowship, and it won't be long until it catches up to
them.

At the end of each Evil player's Move phase, the Evil player rolls a D6. If the score is equal to or less than the current turn number, then the Balrog arrives. It moves onto the board from the centre of the western board edge via the rules for
Reinforcements.

The Bridge of Khazad-dûm -- The bridge is the only way out of Moria, and if it can be destroyed after being crossed then the
Fellowship can escape the pursuit of the
Goblins.

Gandalf may target the Bridge of Khazad-dûm with the Sorcerous Blast Magical Power, providing he is standing on it. If successfully cast, do not follow the normal rules for the Magical Power; instead roll a D6 and consult the chart below. Might may not be used to influence this roll.

D6 Result] 

1.  

[No Effect.2-5 The bridge is damaged but still standing. You may add 1 to further rolls on this chart. These modifiers are cumulative.

6 The bridge is destroyed. Any models on the bridge are removed as a
casualty.

.anchor}LOTHLÓRIEN

T] [hough he has
fallen into the black pit of Moria, Gandalf the Grey has felled the Balrog and bought his com panions enough time to escape the fallen Dwarven kingdom. However, though they have managed to exit the Misty Mountains, the Fellowship have no time to grieve for their fallen friend for the Goblins of Moria still pursue them with relentless
ferocity.

Desperate for refuge, Aragorn leads the Fellowship towards the forest
of Lothlórien, the home of the Galadhrim, in the hope that they will be
able to find sanctuary within the boughs of the forest. Yet the journey is
difficult and the Fellowship are still being chased by the Goblins, who are intent
on laying low those who ventured into their
kingdom.

With the borders of Lothlórien in sight, Aragorn urges his companions forth for one last push as they cross the Silverlode. However, it is not
just Moria Goblins that now pursue the Fellowship, for the Wargs of the
Misty Mountains have joined their Goblin allies in the hunt and now hound the Fellowship as they run for
safety.

The Fellowship are tired and weary, and it will take every ounce of strength, determination and endurance they have left to allow them to reach the safety of the borders of Lothlórien. Yet even if they can
muster the strength to continue onwards, they may still require some unseen aid
to fend off their pursuers, who are closing in around
them.

SPECIAL RULES

Hidden in the Trees -- The Elves of Lórien are hidden in the trees, and will only reveal themselves when others come too close to their
realm.

At the start of the game the Good player places six 25mm markers numbered 1-6 in the eastern half of the board; these markers may not be placed within 6" of another. As soon as any model moves within 12" of the eastern board edge, the Good player rolls a D6 and deploys the Elves within 6" of the corresponding marker. The Elves may not Charge on a turn in which they arrive but may otherwise act
normally.

Weary from the Chase -- The Fellowship have been chased relentlessly by the Goblins and are tired from battle and little
rest.

Good models may not use Heroic March in this
Scenario.

The Wargs -- The Goblins have long had an alliance of sorts with the Wargs of the Misty Mountains who have joined them in their
hunt.

Chieftain;

24 Moria Goblins: 8 with shield, 8 with spear, 8 with Orc bow; 18 Wild Wargs.

LAYOUT

The board represents the edges of Lothlórien. There should be a river running from north to south that is 6" wide and 6" from the western board edge. There is a 4" wide ford in the centre of the river forming a good place to cross. The rest of the board should be dotted with trees, rocks and
bushes.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys the Fellowship within 6" of the eastern bank of the river. The Evil player then deploys the Goblins anywhere west of the river. All other models are kept aside for later in the game.

OBJECTIVES

The Fellowship are being chased by the Goblins and Wargs, and must reach the safety of Lothlórien if they are to
escape.

The game lasts until one player has completed their objective. The Good player wins if four or more members of the Fellowship, including Frodo, escape the board via the eastern board edge. The Evil player wins if four or more members of the Fellowship are slain. Additionally, if Frodo is slain, the Evil player automatically wins.

At the end of each Evil Move phase, D6 Warg models may enter the board via the rules for Reinforcements, from a board edge chosen by the player with Priority. A different board edge may be chosen for each
Warg.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins with Sting and Mithril Coat; Samwise Gamgee; Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin Took; Aragorn -- Strider with bow; Legolas Greenleaf; Gimli, son of Glóin; Boromir of Gondor with shield; Haldir with Elf bow; 6 Wood Elf Warriors with Elf

[]{#bookmark56 .anchor}ARAGORN'S
STAND

H] [aving left the
safety of the forest of Lothlórien behind, and with it the protection of the Galadhrim, the Fellowship have set off down the River Anduin to continue their long and arduous quest to Mordor. It is at Amon Hen, near the falls of Rauros, that the Fellowship must come once more to shore and continue their journey on foot, and so they make camp upon the banks of the Anduin to rest and re-gather their
strength.

It is here that Aragorn finds Frodo, who has now decided to go to
Mordor alone so as not to have the power of the Ring destroy his friends and companions from within. As Aragorn acknowledges Frodo's decision, he notices the blue glow from Sting showing that Orcs are nearby. Before them stand a host of scouting Uruk-hai from Isengard tasked with retrieving the Halflings. All Aragorn can do now is fight them off to
allow Frodo enough time to escape, and hope that help will come to him if the skirmish can be
heard.

As Frodo wanders the woodland path, he is approached by Boromir who suggests that Frodo should lend him the Ring so that he can use it to protect his people. Sensing that the son of Gondor is not
himself, Frodo declines which sends Boromir into a fit of rage -- signs that the Fellowship is indeed breaking. Using the Ring to escape, Frodo makes
his way to the Seeing Seat of Amon Hen, and out of Boromir's reach, before taking off the Ring.

RULES

LAYOUT

The board represents Amon Hen and the Seeing Seat. The Seeing Seat should be placed on a hill 6" from the centre of the northern board edge (see map). The rest of the board should be densely packed with trees, bushes and other
undergrowth.

To the Rescue! -- Having heard the commotion from afar, Legolas and Gimli now race to rescue Aragorn and
Frodo.

At the end of each Good Move phase, the Good player rolls a D6 and adds the turn number. If the total is 10 or more then Legolas and Gimli have arrived and may move onto the board from any board edge via the rules for
Reinforcements.

Scouting Uruk-hai -- The hills are crawling with Uruk-hai who are searching for the Halflings to take them back to
Isengard.

At the end of each Evil Move phase, the Evil player rolls a D6 for each Uruk-hai model not currently on the board. On a 4+, that model may move onto the board from a board edge chosen by the player with Priority via the rules for Reinforcements. Previously slain Warrior models may also return to the board in this manner.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins with Sting and Mithril Coat; Aragorn -- Strider with bow; Legolas Greenleaf; Gimli, son of

The other models will be available as the game goes
on.

OBJECTIVES

The Uruk-hai have come to claim the Ring for Saruman and to kill all who stand in their path. Should either Frodo or Aragorn fall, all shall be
lost.

The Good player wins if Frodo can escape the board via the southern board edge whilst Aragorn is still alive. If either Frodo or Aragorn is slain, the Evil player
wins.

Evil: Lurtz; Uruk-hai Scout Captain with two-handed weapon; 24 Uruk-hai Scouts: 8 with shield, 8 with Uruk-hai bow, 8 with no additional
wargear.

REDEMPTION

W] [ith Aragorn
fighting off dozens of Uruk-hai up by the Seeing Seat, the rest of Saruman's forces are scouring the woodland in search of the Halflings they have been sent to retrieve for their master. With the hills now crawling with Uruk-hai Scouts, the Hobbits decide to hide in the thick undergrowth so as not to be
discovered.

From within their hiding place, Merry and Pippin can see Frodo pressed against a tree, yet as they try to signal him they realise that Frodo
intends to leave and travel to Mordor alone. With an act of great bravery, or perhaps foolishness, Merry and Pippin reveal themselves to the Uruk-hai
to draw them away from Frodo and towards
themselves.

With the Uruk-hai now making a beeline straight for them, Merry and Pippin try to evade their pursuers. However, the Uruk-hai are strong
and fast and soon catch up to their quarry. With the Hobbits all but
cornered, Boromir arrives to attempt to prevent them from being carried away to Isengard, and to make amends for the way he treated
Frodo.

SPECIAL RULES

Random Game Length -- Boromir has to hold out until his allies can join him, however, exactly how long that will be is
unknown.

From the 11^th^ turn onwards, if the roll for Priority is ever a draw then the game ends immediately. If playing this Scenario as part of the campaign, ignore this rule; instead this Scenario will last for the same number of turns as the Aragorn's Stand Scenario went on
for.

Find the Halflings! -- The Uruk-hai have been instructed to bring the Halflings to Isengard unharmed and
unspoiled.

Evil models may not target a Hobbit with shooting attacks. Additionally, any Hobbit that loses its final Wound is not slain but knocked unconscious; they count as being under the effects of the Paralyse Magical Power. Uruk-hai models treat Hobbit models as Light Objects.

LAYOUT

The board represents the woodland around Amon Hen, and as such should be dotted with plenty of trees, bushes and
rocks.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys Boromir in the centre of the board and then deploys Merry and Pippin within 3" of him. The Evil player then deploys their models anywhere within 3" of either the northern or western board
edges.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Boromir of
Gondor;

Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin

OBJECTIVES

The Uruk-hai have been tasked with capturing the Halflings and taking them to Isengard, something that Boromir is desperately trying to prevent.

The Evil player wins if they have carried both Merry and
Pippin

off the board via any table edge when the game ends. If when the game ends only one Hobbit has been carried off the board, the game is a draw. In any other result, the Good player
wins.

[]{#bookmark63 .anchor}BREAKING OF THE
FELLOWSHIP

T] [he Fellowship is
now all but broken; Frodo and Sam have crossed the Anduin and are making for Mordor alone, and Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk- hai Scouts who are now returning to Isengard with
their

prize. Those that set out from Rivendell in order to destroy the Ring of Power are now scattered, and there is little they can do now except to try to keep each other
alive.

Yet the sound of the Horn of Gondor has been heard by Boromir's
allies, and now Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are racing to the side of Boromir. However, Lurtz, the Uruk-hai leader, is now stalking Boromir with
deadly intent, and notching black-fletched arrows in his bow intended for the
son of Gondor. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must fight through the remaining Uruk-hai Scouts if they are to reach Boromir in
time.

With most of the Uruk-hai returning to Isengard, some stay behind in order to try to kill all those who are still left at Amon Hen. Boromir
is badly wounded, having fought off dozens of Uruk-hai as he tried in vain
to protect Merry and Pippin. Even as he is surrounded by those he has
slain, more Uruk-hai keep coming to claim the life of this mighty warrior and help seems far away.

OBJECTIVES

With Frodo and Sam having gone, and Merry and Pippin captured, all that matters now is for the remaining members of the Fellowship to
survive.

The game lasts until one force is wiped out. The Good player wins if at least two Good Hero models have survived when the Uruk- hai have been wiped out. The Evil player wins if the Good player fails to complete their
objective.

SPECIAL RULES

Last Stand -- Boromir is mortally wounded. However, this will not stop him from fighting to the bitter
end.

Boromir starts the game with 3 Might points and only a single Wound. Additionally, Boromir may re-roll any dice in a Duel roll and any dice when rolling To
Wound.

Shield Throw -- An expert fighter, Lurtz will use all manner of
wargear as a weapon should he be required
to.

LAYOUT

The board represents the woodland around Amon Hen, and as such should be dotted with plenty of trees, bushes and
rocks.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys Boromir 6" from the centre of the western board edge, and then deploys Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli within 6" of the eastern board edge. The Evil player deploys Lurtz in the centre of the board. They then deploy the Uruk-hai Scout Captain and nine Uruk-hai Scouts anywhere within 12" of Boromir. The rest of the Uruk-hai Scouts are deployed within 12" of Aragorn, Legolas and
Gimli.

Once per game, Lurtz can choose to use his shield as a throwing weapon. This has a Strength of 4, and any Man-sized (or smaller) model hit by the shield is automatically knocked Prone. Once Lurtz has thrown his shield, he no longer carries it and cannot use it for the remainder of the
battle.

[]{#bookmark65 .anchor}AMBUSH AT AMON
HEN

F] [ollowing their
departure from the safety of the forest of Lórien, the remaining members of the Fellowship have made their way down the waters of the Anduin before mooring their boats upon the shores of Amon Hen to rest. It is here that the Ring finally latches onto Boromir's desire to possess it and bring it to Minas Tirith, driving the Man of Gondor mad as he attempts to take the Ring from
Frodo.

Meanwhile, Saruman has unleashed his fighting Uruk-hai from Isengard. Their mission is simple, to capture and deliver the Halflings to the
White Wizard and to kill anyone who should get in their way. With great haste and the desire to taste man-flesh driving them, the scouts of Isengard soon track down the Fellowship and engage them in battle upon the banks of the Anduin.

With Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas fighting the Uruk-hai off, Merry and Pippin are in great danger of being seized and taken to Isengard. Only Boromir stands between the Hobbits and the fearsome Uruk-hai and, desperate to find redemption for the way he treated Frodo, Boromir
gives his all in his attempt to deliver Merry and Pippin from harm. It is
whilst he is fending off the Uruk-hai Scouts that Boromir comes face-to-face
with Lurtz, the leader of the Uruk-hai forces; a meeting that would prove a fateful one for the son of
Gondor.

With death and loss surrounding him, Frodo has made the decision to go to Mordor alone, in order to prevent further harm befalling his
friends. Can Frodo escape in time, or will he fall foul of the scouts of
Isengard?

LAYOUT

The board should be densely packed with trees and other foliage. The western board edge represents the River Anduin and should have two boats placed at the point marked X. The Seeing Seat should be placed in the eastern half of the board as per the
map.

STARTING POSITIONS

Aragorn and Frodo start the game in base contact with the Seeing Seat, whilst Legolas and Gimli can be placed anywhere within 6" of the north-east corner of the board. Merry, Pippin and Boromir are placed between 6"-12" of the boats and no more than 1" away from each other.

The Evil player then places the Uruk-hai Scout Captain and 12 Uruk-hai Scouts within 6" of the Seeing Seat, and Lurtz and the other 12 Uruk-hai Scouts within 12" of Boromir, but no closer than
6".

Finally, Sam is set up anywhere on the board at least 12" away from any other member of the
Fellowship.

SPECIAL RULES

Find the Halflings! -- Under strict instructions from their master, Saruman, the Uruk-hai will not kill the Hobbits. Instead, they intend
to incapacitate them and take them to Isengard to await their
fate.

Should a Hobbit suffer their final Wound, instead of being slain they will recover a single Wound and be knocked out instead -- treat them as being subject to the Paralyse Magical Power. Any Evil model may carry a knocked-out Hobbit as if he were a Heavy Object (see page 110 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Rules Manual). Should any Good model end its move in base contact with a knocked-out Hobbit, they will automatically revive them and they may act as normal, although they will start their move in the Prone position. Should any Evil model leave any table edge whilst carrying a knocked-out Hobbit, with the exception of the western edge, the Evil player is considered to have captured that
Hobbit.

The Legions of Isengard -- The scouts of Isengard soon flood the area around Amon Hen, providing the Fellowship with a huge task -- and increasingly dire odds to
overcome.

At the end of each Evil Move phase, roll a D6 for each Evil Warrior that has previously been slain. On a 4+, that model may enter play anywhere along the northern, eastern or southern board
edges.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins with Sting and Mithril
Coat;

Samwise Gamgee; Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin
Took;

Aragorn -- Strider with bow; Legolas
Greenleaf;

Gimli, son of Glóin; Boromir of
Gondor.

All Good models have an Elven
Cloak.

Evil: Lurtz; Uruk-hai Scout Captain; 24 Uruk-hai Scouts: 8 with no additional equipment, 8 with shield, 8 with Uruk-hai
bow.

OBJECTIVES

Frodo has made his decision; he is going to leave the Fellowship and journey to Mordor alone. The Uruk-hai are under strict orders to deliver the Hobbits to Saruman, alive and
unspoiled.

The game ends as soon as Frodo leaves the board. If Frodo escapes the board by moving into base contact with the boats, the Good player is the winner. If Frodo is captured by the Uruk-hai, the Evil player is the
winner.

The Evil player can claim a draw even if Frodo escapes the board, so long as they have captured any two of the remaining
Hobbits.

[]{#bookmark68 .anchor}THE TAMING OF
SMÉAGOL

W] [hen he left the
Fellowship on the banks of Amon Hen, it was Frodo's intent to travel to Mordor alone so as not to watch as his companions fall victim to the power of the Ring as he had seen Boromir start to do. However, seeing his friend crossing the Anduin and guessing his intent, Sam has decided to wade out and go with Frodo to Mordor, and nothing Frodo can say will deter Sam from breaking the promise he made to Gandalf back in the Shire to accompany Frodo to the very
end.

Since then Frodo and Sam have made slow progress to
Mordor.

The journey is difficult and has forced the two Hobbits to traverse
the wilderness around Amon Hen before venturing into the labyrinth of
razor- sharp rocks known as Eymn Muil. The hills of Emyn Muil are covered in fog, making navigating them difficult and the chance of getting lost ever increasing.

Yet, although they seem lost within Emyn Muil, the Hobbits are aware that they are not alone within the hills. The creature Gollum has been following the Ringbearer since at least the Mines of Moria, if not
longer, and now nears his quarry. The lure of the Ring is too much for Gollum to resist and, under the cover of darkness, he attempts to sneak up on the sleeping Hobbits and take the Ring for himself. Should Gollum kill the Hobbits and claim the Ring then all may well be lost. However, if the Hobbits can subdue Gollum, they may find themselves with an unlikely ally.

The Good player deploys Frodo and Sam in the centre of the board. The Evil player then deploys Sméagol (though he is very much Gollum at this point) anywhere touching the eastern board edge.

OBJECTIVES

Gollum has tracked the Hobbits since Moria, and now has the opportunity to strike and steal the Ring. If they become aware of Gollum, the Hobbits will try to subdue
him.

SPECIAL RULES

Sleeping Hobbits -- The Hobbits are asleep and are unaware of the creature sneaking up on them as they
rest.

The Hobbits start the game Prone and may not move until they are disturbed. As Gollum approaches, there is a chance he will wake the Hobbits. Roll a D6 before Gollum
moves.

If the number rolled is higher than the distance between him and the Hobbits, or a 6 is rolled, he has disturbed them and the Hobbits immediately stand up and act normally from this point onwards. If Gollum attacks a sleeping Hobbit, the Hobbits have been woken and may act normally from this point
onwards.

Subduing Gollum -- The Hobbits are not trying to kill their attacker, but instead intend to subdue
him.

If Gollum suffers his last Wound then he is subdued rather than slain. However, Gollum cares not for the wellbeing of the Hobbits and will try to kill them as
normal.

Sting -- Gollum has encountered Sting before and rightfully fears
it.

Each time Gollum loses a Fight against Frodo, he must make a Courage test. If the test is failed, Gollum surrenders to the Hobbits and is automatically
subdued.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins with Sting, Mithril Coat and Elven Cloak; Samwise Gamgee with Elven
Cloak.

Evil: Sméagol.

The Good player wins if Gollum is subdued. The Evil player wins if Gollum kills Frodo and reclaims the Ring. If Gollum is subdued but Sam has been slain, the game is a
draw.

[]{#bookmark71 .anchor}THE DEAD
MARSHES

T] [heir encounter in
Emyn Muil with the
creature

Gollum has presented Frodo and Sam with something rather unexpected: a guide. With Sméagol pledging himself to serve Frodo as the 'Master of the Precious', Frodo asks him to lead them to the Black Gate of Mordor so that they may find a way into the accursed lands to try to rid Middle- earth of the Ring.

Agreeing to do so, Sméagol leaps off ahead to show the Hobbits the way to Mordor, first leading them through the labyrinth of hills that make
up Emyn Muil and into more open terrain. However, they next come to what seems to be a huge bog. An ancient battlefield of long ago that has
since become waterlogged and filled with the corpses of Men, Elves and Orcs
-- the Dead Marshes.

Sméagol knows the safe passage across the marshes, one that even the
Orcs of Mordor do not know and so is relatively safe from the eyes of the
enemy. Yet as they cross the foetid marshland, the dead things in the water
begin to stir, trying to lure the unwitting Hobbits into the water with lights
so that they may light little candles of their
own.

As Frodo, Sam and Gollum cross the Dead Marshes, their hearts become filled with dread as the sound of screeching can be heard above piercing through the air. Upon the back of its Fell Beast, one of the
nine Ringwraiths has tracked the Hobbits to the marshes and now circles
above to try to find its quarry below and retrieve the One
Ring.

height="2.5034722222222223in"}

LAYOUT

The board represents the Dead Marshes. There should be six areas of marshland around the board, one of which is in the centre. The rest of the board should have a selection of bushes, hedges and rocky outcrops dotted
around.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys Frodo, Sam and Sméagol touching the centre of the western board edge. The Evil player deploys one Dead Marsh Spectre in the centre of each piece of marshland, and then deploys the Ringwraith touching the centre of the eastern board edge.

OBJECTIVES

With the Ringwraith overhead, Frodo and his companions must cross the Dead Marshes without being noticed if they wish to keep the Ring away from the
Nazgûl.

SPECIAL RULES

Hunt the Ringbearer -- The exact whereabouts of the Hobbits is unknown, and they must try to sneak past the Nazgûl and Spectres if they are to escape.

All Evil models start the game as Sentries. However, if a model would normally spot a Good model, they will not raise the alarm. Instead, only that model will have been alerted to their presence and may act normally, the others will remain as
Sentries.

Don't follow the Lights -- The Spectres of the Dead Marshes are trying to lure the Hobbits into the marsh and to their
doom.

If a Good model is moved into any of the marshland as a result of a Spectre's 'A Fell Light is in Them' special rule, they must roll a D6. On a 1 or 2 the model succumbs to the powers of the Spectres and falls into the marsh; they are now Prone. A model that has succumbed to the Spectres cannot act in any way, and if they remain in the marsh during the End phase of the following turn, they are removed as a casualty. A friendly model can rescue a model that has succumbed by ending their Move in base contact with them; the rescued model may then act as
normal.

Call of the Ring -- If Frodo uses the Ring then the Ringwraith shall surely find him.

If Frodo puts the Ring on then the Ringwraith will no longer be a Sentry and will act as
normal.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins with Sting, Mithril Coat and Elven Cloak; Samwise Gamgee with Elven Cloak;
Sméagol.

Evil: Ringwraith on Fell Beast with 0 Might, 10 Will and 0 Fate; 6 Dead Marsh
Spectres.

The Good player wins if Frodo can escape the board via the eastern board edge. The Evil player wins if Frodo is
slain.

[]{#bookmark74 .anchor}AMBUSH AT
ITHILIEN

A] [s the strength of
the Dark Lord continues to rise, all manner of Evil is drawn to Mordor, pledging themselves to the service of Sauron and to fight his war. It is for just this reason that the Haradrim march north from their homes in the far south of Middle-earth, bringing with them the lumbering Mûmakil that roam their lands to destroy the free peoples of the
West.

It is the sworn duty of the Rangers of Gondor to protect their lands
from any and all intruders that stray into the borders of Ithilien, and it is
with that purpose that they set out to halt the relentless march of the Men
from the south lands, for if the Haradrim and their formidable war beasts
can be prevented from reaching Mordor unscathed then Sauron's forces cannot be bolstered for the battles yet to
come.

Yet to reach the Black Gate and enter Mordor, the Haradrim must first travel through the trees and thick undergrowth of Ithilien. It is here
that the Haradrim are the victims of a sudden ambush at the hands of Faramir and the Rangers of Gondor. From the bushes, the Rangers of Gondor fire a hail of arrows upon their foes in an attempt to weaken the forces of
the Haradrim, and in turn those of the Dark
Lord.

height="2.5034722222222223in"}

LAYOUT

There should be lots of hedges, trees and bushes dotted around the board, although ideally not heavily impeding the movement across the centre of the board. The terrain should be denser along the northern and southern board
edges.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Evil player deploys the two Mûmakil touching the western board edge as shown. They may then deploy their remaining models anywhere within 6" of either Mûmak. The Good player may then split their force in half -- one half containing 12 Rangers and Faramir, and the remaining models in the other half. The Good player then deploys Faramir's half anywhere within 6" of the southern board edge then their remaining models within 6" of the northern board
edge.

OBJECTIVES

The Haradrim are attempting to journey to Mordor to join with Sauron's armies before the assault on Minas Tirith. The more of them that can make it to the Black Gate, the stronger the Dark Lord will be. Faramir has noted that the lumbering Mûmakil pose the greatest threat to Gondor and has tasked his Rangers to see to their downfall.

The game lasts until there are no Mûmakil left on the board. The Evil side wins if both Mûmakil can move off of the board via the eastern board edge. The Good player wins if they can slay both of the Mûmakil. If only one Mûmak has managed to escape the board, the game is a
draw.

SPECIAL RULES

Unseen Hunters -- The Haradrim have no idea that they are being watched by the Rangers of Gondor, let alone that they are walking into an ambush.

At the start of the game, before the first Priority is rolled, each Good model may make a 'free' shooting attack as if it were the Shoot phase. Additionally, for the first three turns of the game, all Good models gain the Stalk Unseen special rule and may re- roll any 1s To Wound when making a shooting
attack.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Faramir, Captain of Gondor with
bow;

Madril, Captain of Ithilien; Damrod, Ranger of
Ithilien;

Frodo Baggins with Sting, Mithril Coat and Elven Cloak; Samwise Gamgee with Elven Cloak; Sméagol; Anborn, Ranger of Ithilien; Mablung, Ranger of Ithilien; 24 Rangers of Gondor: 16 with no additional equipment, 8 with
spear.

Evil: 2 War Mûmakil of Harad each with 12 Haradrim Warriors with bow; 24 Haradrim Warriors with
spear.

.anchor}OSGILIATH

A] [fter their
encounter with the Haradrim in Ithilien, Frodo and Sam are captured by the Rangers of Gondor who had been lurking in the undergrowth and had defeated the Haradrim. Their leader, Faramir
of

Gondor, has instructed that the two Hobbits be taken to Ithilien where they will be interrogated, for the Men of Gondor believe them to be nothing more than spies of the Dark Lord.

No sooner have Faramir and his Rangers reached the city, the next
assault on Osgiliath begins. Orcs flood into the city and the Men of Gondor are thrust once more into a desperate fight for survival. As the battle
rages on, the sound of a Nazgûl can be heard overhead, and Frodo knows that he cannot linger. Knowing Frodo must escape from Osgiliath, Faramir realises the importance of the situation and offers to help; though it
may have come too late.

Within Ithilien, the truth of Frodo's journey, and the item of great
power that he carries around his neck, comes to light. Seeing a chance to show
his quality to his father, Faramir instructs that the Ring must go to
Gondor, and so the Rangers begin to take the Hobbits to Minas Tirith. However, they must first pass through the ruined city of Osgiliath upon the banks
of the Anduin and aid their beleaguered allies
there.

height="1.3402777777777777in"}

LAYOUT

The board represents the ruined city of Osgiliath. There should be three ruined buildings spread evenly across the board. The rest of the board should be littered with other smaller ruins, piles of rubble and rocks.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys Faramir, Frodo, Sam and Sméagol 12" from the centre of the western board edge. The Good player then deploys the rest of their models anywhere on the board at least 9" away from the northern, eastern or western board edges. The Evil player then deploys the Orcs anywhere within 3" of the northern, eastern or western board
edges.

The Ringwraith will be available
later.

OBJECTIVES

Frodo must escape Osgiliath or the Ring may well be captured. The Orcs do not know of the presence of the Ringbearer and are more concerned with capturing the city. The game lasts until Frodo is no longer on the board. The Good player wins if Frodo can escape the board via the eastern board edge. The Evil player wins if they control more of the ruined buildings than the Good side at the end of the game. If both players achieve their objective, the game is a draw; however, if Frodo is slain, the Evil side automatically wins.

SPECIAL RULES

Capturing Buildings -- The Orcs have come to claim Osgiliath by capturing key areas of the
city.

A building is considered to be controlled by a player if they have more models wholly within the building than their opponent. Control of a building can change multiple times over the course of the
battle.

Nazgûl! -- One of the Nine has tracked Frodo to Osgiliath, and now hunts the Ringbearer from its Fell
Beast.

The Ringwraith will automatically arrive at the end of the Evil player's third Move phase from the western board edge via the rules for Reinforcements. Once per game, during the Priority phase, the Nazgûl can let out a terrifying shriek, which will reduce all Good models' Courage value by 3 until the end of the turn. Additionally, with Frodo beginning to fall more under the influence of the Ring, he cannot risk putting it on. If Frodo puts on the Ring, he is removed as a
casualty.

Reinforcements -- With the battle raging on, both sides have reinforcements rushing to join the
fray.

Each time a Warrior model is removed as a casualty, roll a D6. On a 1-3 that model takes no further part in the game. On a 4+, that model may re-enter the board at the end of its side's next Move phase via the rules for Reinforcements. Good models enter from the southern board edge. Evil models may enter from the northern, eastern or western board
edges.

Poor Sméagol -- Following the beating at the hands of the Rangers, Gollum is now fully intent on killing Frodo and Sam, but he won't risk such treachery with Faramir and his Rangers
around.

Sméagol is under the control of the Good player, however, Good models may not benefit from any Heroic Action that Sméagol declares.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Faramir, Captain of Gondor with bow; Madril, Captain of Ithilien; Damrod, Ranger of Ithilien; Anborn, Ranger of Ithilien; Mablung, Ranger of Ithilien; Frodo Baggins with Sting, Mithril Coat and Elven Cloak; Samwise Gamgee with Elven Cloak; Sméagol; 13 Warriors of Minas Tirith: 4 with shield, 4 with spear & shield, 4 with bow, 1 with banner; 12 Rangers of Gondor: 4 with spear, 8 with no additional wargear; 6 Osgiliath Veterans: 2 with shield, 2 with spear, 2 with
bow.

Evil: 3 Orc Captains with shield; 1 Ringwraith on Fell Beast with 2 Might, 10 Will and 2 Fate; 37 Orc Warriors: 12 with shield, 12 with spear, 6 with Orc bow, 6 with two-handed weapon, 1 with
banner.

[]{#bookmark80 .anchor}SMÉAGOL'S
TREACHERY

B] [elieving it was
the Hobbits' fault he was beaten and mistreated by Faramir's Rangers in Ithilien, Sméagol is now fully intent on betraying Frodo and Sam and taking back the Precious; though he cannot hope to do it by himself. Instead, Sméagol plots to lure the Hobbits into the tunnels of Cirith Ungol where the terror that lurks within can finish them off and allow Sméagol to take the Ring once the Hobbits are
dead.

Yet if Sméagol's plan to lure Frodo into his trap is to succeed, he
must first find a way to remove Sam from the equation. Sam's loyalty to
Frodo is unwavering, and with him watching and questioning Sméagol's every move, it will be all but impossible to trick Frodo into falling into
the clutches of Shelob within the tunnels of Cirith
Ungol.

In an effort to drive a wedge between the two companions, Sméagol
begins to whisper in Frodo's ear that he shouldn't trust Sam, as he only wants
the Ring for himself. With his mind weakened by holding the Ring for so
long, and being so close to Mordor, doubt begins to creep into Frodo and soon
he is questioning his loyal friend. Sam now needs to convince Frodo that
it is Sméagol who is treacherous, otherwise Sméagol's and Gollum's plan to separate them will have
succeeded.

SET-UP

For this mini-game you will need a pack of ordinary playing cards. Separate the hearts out from the rest of the deck and shuffle them; then lay them out face-down in a single line as shown -- this is the Path.

Next, shuffle the remaining three suits together to form the playing deck, and then deal a hand of five cards to each
player.

STARTING POSITIONS

Sam starts the game to the left of the western-most card, whilst Gollum starts the game to the right of the eastern-most card as shown. Frodo is placed on the central
card.

OBJECTIVES

Both Sam and Gollum are trying to convince Frodo to believe them and be rid of the other. Whichever of them reaches Frodo first is the winner.

GAME TURN

To decide who goes first both players roll-off, re-rolling any ties, with whoever scored the highest going first. Players then alternate turns until there is a
winner.

TIPS

It is important to remember that as the cards each player is moving along is a single suit, there will only be one of each card on that path. So, if you have seen the King on your opponent's side of the Path, you know that there won't be one on your
side.

Also, you will often know what is on your opponent's side of the Path, whilst they will often know what is on your side. This can make for a very interesting game where you are both trying to work out the best possible cards to play each
turn.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Samwise
Gamgee.

Evil: Gollum.

height="1.5666666666666667in"}

On a player's turn they may do one of three
things:] 

-   

[Attempt to Move: When a player attempts to move their character, they will try to move one card along the Path closer to Frodo. They play a card from their hand face-up. Then, making sure they don't see it themselves, they show their opponent the card they are trying to move to.Their opponent must then say if the card
player is higher or lower than the card they are trying to move to. If the card they played is equal to or higher than the card shown, they flip it face-up and move their character onto
it;

they then take another go. If the card they played is lower than the card shown, they place it back face-down without looking, do not move, and their turn immediately
ends.

It is important to be completely honest when playing this game, for the benefit of both
players.] 

-   
-   

[Discard Hand: If a player wishes, they can discard all of the cards in their hand and then draw a fresh hand of five cards from the playing deck. Their turn then ends.Draw New Hand: If a player
has no cards in their hand, they may then draw a new hand of five cards. Their turn then
ends.

[]{#bookmark83 .anchor}SHELOB'S
LAIR

G] [ollum's plan to
remove Sam from Frodo's side has succeeded; Frodo has believed Gollum's whispers in his ears that Sam wants the Ring for himself and has sent his friend home. With Sam gone, Frodo continues to climb the Winding Stair above Minas Morgul towards the pass of Cirith Ungol and the unknown danger that lies within its dark and cobwebbed
tunnels.

As Frodo climbs upwards, Sam begins the long descent down the stairs filled with regret that he has failed his master and the promise he
made to Gandalf to not leave him. However, as Sam descends, he finds the remains of the Lembas bread he was accused of stealing scattered down
the mountain, and quickly realises the deception of Gollum and the ulterior motives the creature has for his
friend.

With anger bubbling up inside him, and the fear that Frodo may be in great danger, Sam climbs back up the stairs and into the pass of Cirith Ungol. Yet Frodo is in more peril than either Hobbit realises, for
Cirith Ungol is home to Shelob, the spawn of Ungoliant. This huge, spider-like creature stalks the tunnels ever in search of tasty morsels that have
crept into her lair; and few that ever enter her domain ever
leave...

LAYOUT

The board represents part of the high pass of Cirith Ungol, and as such should be covered in various rocky outcrops, rock piles and large rocks that are
impassable.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys Frodo in the centre of the board, and then deploys Sam touching the centre of the western board edge. The Evil player deploys Shelob touching the centre of the southern board edge. They then deploy Sméagol anywhere on the board at least 12" away from any other
model.

OBJECTIVES

To survive, the Hobbits must somehow fend off the vile creature or they will soon find themselves as Shelob's next
meal.

SPECIAL RULES

Samwise the Brave -- With his master in mortal danger, and now wielding the Phial of Galadriel, Sam will face anything to ensure he protects Frodo.

Sam will automatically pass all Courage tests in this Scenario. Additionally, as Sam carries the Phial of Galadriel, he causes Terror.

Not here, not so close to the Eye! -- Frodo wouldn't risk putting the Ring on so close to
Sauron.

Frodo may not put on the Ring in this
Scenario.

Shadowed Hunter -- Shelob seeks defenceless and tasty morsels, not ones that fight
back.

Shelob may not spend Will points to pass Courage tests in this Scenario.

Sting -- The bitter spike of this ancient sword can cause Shelob great harm if it can be set against her
flesh.

Strikes from Sting will automatically Wound Shelob. If Frodo is slain, place a 25mm marker where he fell. If Sam moves into base contact with this marker, he may pick up and wield Sting from that point after.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins with Sting, Mithril Coat and Elven Cloak; Samwise Gamgee with Elven
Cloak.

Evil: Shelob;

UNGOL

T] [he encounter with
Shelob has left Frodo limp and lifeless, and Sam believes his friend to have fallen victim to the vile creature. As Sam mourns the loss of Frodo, Sting begins to glow near him signaling the imminent arrival of a band of Orcs and Uruk-hai from the nearby Tower of Cirith Ungol. From a hiding place within the rocks, Sam overhears one Orc say that Frodo is not dead but just paralysed, and will be taken to the tower to be tortured.

Distraught that he didn't realise his friend was still alive and that
he had let Frodo be taken to Cirith Ungol, Sam grips Sting, vows to rescue
Frodo from the clutches of the Orcs and Uruk-hai that had captured him and makes his way down the stairs towards to the
tower.

Within Cirith Ungol, the leaders of the Orcs and Uruk-hai have begun
to squabble over the Mithril coat that was worn by Frodo, each wanting to claim the trinket for themselves. Tensions within the garrison are
already frayed, and what started as a mere disagreement soon becomes an all-out brawl that engulfs the entire fortress. Orcs and Uruk-hai now fight
against each other in a battle of bitter resentment that has been brewing for
months and only needed a slight push to
begin.

In order to find Frodo, Sam must fight his way through the swirling
melee of Cirith Ungol, though luckily for him the Orcs and Uruk-hai are
paying little attention to him and more on killing each other. This is Sam's
chance to sneak through Cirith Ungol relatively unnoticed and rescue his
friend.

LAYOUT

The board represents the Tower of Cirith Ungol. The board is made up of two fortress walls, one outer and one inner, and the tower itself. A rock face runs along the northern and eastern board edges. The outer wall is 3" wide and runs 3" away from the western and southern board edges and the gates to Cirith Ungol should be in the south-western corner (see map). The inner wall should be 3" high, 3" wide and 6" away from the outer wall; it should have a selection of stairs up to it from the ground. On top of this inner wall should be the main tower, the base of which should be 9" wide, and 9" long (as shown on the map) and should have two doorways in the side that are accessible from the inner wall. The top of the tower base should have two trapdoors on it that the doors will lead to. The main tower is placed atop the tower base (see map), and should have a door on it facing towards the south-western board
edge.

STARTING POSITIONS

Sam is deployed touching the south-western board
edge.

A marker representing the Mithril Coat is placed on the inner walls as close to the centre of the board as
possible.

The players then alternate placing a model anywhere within the walls of Cirith Ungol, starting with the Evil
player.

Models may not be placed within 2" of another model, or within 1" of the Mithril
Coat.

OBJECTIVES

The Orcs and Uruk-hai have descended into rioting over the Mithril Coat, both wanting to claim the shiny
shirt.

The game lasts until either Sam is slain, or he reaches Frodo at the top of the tower. Whichever side is in possession of the Mithril Coat at the end of the game is the winner. If no one possesses the Mithril Coat, the game is a
draw.

SPECIAL RULES

The Mithril Coat -- The Uruk-hai and Orcs are vying for control of the Mithril coat.

The Mithril Coat is a Light Object. Models carrying the Mithril Coat cannot wear it and so do not gain any bonus from it. Sam may never carry the Mithril
Coat.

Controlling Sam -- Sam is hurriedly trying to find Frodo and is not concerned by the petty squabbles of those within Cirith
Ungol.

Sam is controlled by whichever side has Priority as if he was a model in their force. He must abide by the following
rules:] 

-   
-   
-   

[Sam must always move his full Move allowance if he is not charging, and must always try to move closer to reaching Frodo.Sam may
move through models belonging to the player that controls him, though he cannot finish his move in their Control Zone.Other models can never benefit from Heroic Actions declared by Sam.That's for my old Gaffer! -- Sam is distraught by the
capture of Frodo, and will do anything to save his
friend.

Sam carries Sting in this Scenario, and also increases his Attacks characteristic to 2. Sam may spend a single point of Might each turn without depleting his own store, even if he has no Might remaining. Additionally, Sam causes Terror in this
Scenario.

Doorways -- The Tower of Cirith Ungol has many doorways leading to other areas of the
fortress.

Any model that starts its Move in base contact with a doorway on the inner wall, or a trapdoor on the base of the tower may spend their entire Move allowance to move through
them.

If moving from a trapdoor, place the model in base contact with the nearest door. If moving from a door, place the model in base contact with the nearest trapdoor. If Sam begins his move in base contact with the door on the main tower, he may move through it to reach Frodo. It will take Sam until the end of the following turn to climb the tower, at which point he will reach Frodo and the game will end.

PARTICIPANTS

As they cross Gorgoroth, they notice that the plains begin to empty as
the Orcish legions begin to march towards the Black Gate and the war

them.

traverse the barren plains if they are to reach their
goal.

However, the Plateau of Gorgoroth is teeming with Orcs that make up
the Dark Lord's armies, and crossing it unseen will be all but impossible as
the two Hobbits will inevitably stick out. To hide themselves from
unfriendly eyes, and to help them blend in to their surroundings, Frodo and Sam
have donned some pieces of Orcish armour allowing them to cross through the plains without drawing attention to
themselves.

LAYOUT

The board represents the plateau of Gorgoroth, and as such should be relatively barren with only a few rocks and dead shrubbery dotted around the
board.

SPECIAL RULES

Orc Armour -- To try to bypass the Orc army, Frodo and Sam have donned some Orcish armour to blend
in.

Frodo and Sam both count as wearing armour and so their Defence characteristics will be increased by 1. Additionally, until they are discovered, Frodo and Sam may move through enemy models as if they weren't there, so long as they do not finish their move in base contact with an enemy
model.

Not here, not so close to the Eye! -- Frodo wouldn't risk putting on the Ring so close to
Sauron.

Frodo may not put the Ring on in this
Scenario.

On the March -- The Orcs are unaware of the Hobbits nearby, and will keep marching to war if they are not
discovered.

Until the Hobbits are discovered, the Orcs must move at least 2" towards the northern board edge each turn and may not Charge. Evil models that move into base contact with the northern board edge will escape and go off to war. Once per game, after Priority has been determined, the Orc Taskmaster may halt the march in order to whip the Orcs back into line. When this happens, no Evil models will move that
turn.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys Frodo and Sam touching the centre of the western board edge. The Evil player then deploys their models within 6" of the centre of the southern board
edge.

OBJECTIVES

Frodo and Sam must bypass the Orcs without being found
out.

If the Hobbits are discovered, the Orcs will surely kill
them.

The game lasts for 10 turns. The Good player wins if Frodo can escape the board via the eastern board edge. The Evil player wins if Frodo is slain.

Discovering the Hobbits -- Though they are disguised, there is a chance that the Hobbits' scent will be picked up by the
Orcs.

During the End phase of each turn, check to see if either of the Hobbits are within 6" of any enemy models. If so, roll a D6. On a 6, the Hobbits have been discovered and are at the mercy of the Orcs. Additionally, the Hobbits will automatically be discovered if they Charge an enemy model or target an enemy model with their Throw Stones special
rule.

PARTICIPANTS

Good: Frodo Baggins in Orc
armour;

Samwise Gamgee in Orc
armour.

Evil: Orc Captain with shield; Orc
Taskmaster;

24 Orc Warriors: 8 with shield, 8 with spear, 4 with Orc bow and 4 with two-handed
weapon.

[]{#bookmark92 .anchor}THE END OF ALL
THINGS

A] [fter setting out
from the Shire many months
ago,

Frodo and Sam have finally reached the foot of Mount Doom. They have endured great peril, hardship and loss on their way, yet together they have brought the Ring all
the

way into Mordor and now intend to destroy it once and for all, even if in doing so they forfeit their own
lives.

However, the Hobbits must still climb the mountain of fire to reach
the Crack of Doom where the Ring can be destroyed. The climb is steep and
the heat radiating from Mount Doom makes the climb all the more difficult. As they climb, the Ring tries to corrupt Frodo once more, sapping his
will to continue and making it hard for Frodo to keep his footing. Seeing
his friend struggling with such a burden, Sam helps Frodo by carrying him
as far up the mountain as he can; but the two Hobbits are not
alone.

Though they thought they had seen the last of Gollum in Shelob's lair,
the twisted creature had survived and been drawn once more to power of the Ring; now completely consumed by his desperate need to possess it. With Frodo trying to make for the Crack of Doom, Gollum reveals himself from his hiding place and tries to take the Ring from
Frodo.

As Frodo struggles against both Gollum and the will of the Ring, his
allies at the Black Gate are running out of time. Surrounded by the legions of the Dark Lord, Aragorn and his companions are fighting for their lives in an effort to draw Sauron's gaze away from Mount Doom and onto themselves. With his friends risking everything to buy him one last
chance, Frodo must conjure up the strength to destroy the Ring for good, or
Middle- earth will be plunged into
darkness...

LAYOUT

This scenario is unusual as it requires two separate playing areas; a 2'x2' one for the Crack of Doom and a 4'x4' one for the Black Gate. The Crack of Doom board should have half of the board representing the outside of Mount Doom with a pathway up to the door in the side of the mountain, which then leads to the walkway and the precipice above the lava (see map). The Black Gate board should have the Black Gate running along the eastern board edge whilst the rest of the board is relatively
barren.

STARTING POSITIONS

The Good player deploys Frodo and Sam touching the south-west corner of the Crack of Doom board. They then deploy all the rest of their models within 6" of the centre of the Black Gate board. The Evil player deploys all of their models (except Gollum) on the Black Gate board at least 6" away from any Good model.

OBJECTIVES

Frodo must destroy the Ring, and must do so quickly or
his

friends will
perish.

The game lasts until either Frodo has destroyed the Ring, is taken over by the Ring, or is slain. The Good player wins if the Ring is destroyed. The Evil player wins if Frodo is either slain or taken over by the Ring. Additionally, if all the Good Heroes at the Black Gate are slain, the best result the Good player can achieve is a draw.

SPECIAL RULES

Not here, not so close to the Eye! -- Frodo wouldn't risk putting the Ring on so close to
Sauron.

Frodo may not put on the Ring in this
Scenario.

The Power of the Ring -- With its master so close by, the Ring is trying everything it can to corrupt Frodo and return to
Sauron.

At the start of each turn, before Priority is rolled, the Evil player may use one of the following powers to try to slow Frodo down and corrupt him. To use one of these powers the Evil player declares which power they wish to use and rolls a D6. If the score is equal to or higher than the score required, they may use the power:

Destroying the Ring -- The Ring's power is becoming too great and it must be destroyed.

To destroy the Ring, Frodo must be in base contact with the edge of the precipice over the lava. Frodo will then enter a battle of wills with the Ring. Both players roll a D6 (re-rolling any ties) and compare results. If the Good player wins this roll three times in a row, the Ring is destroyed. If the Evil player wins this roll three times in a row, the Ring corrupts Frodo and the game ends. Frodo may use Might to influence these
rolls.

Gandalf's Staff -- Following his encounter with the Witch-king, Gandalf no longer possesses his Wizard's
staff.

Gandalf does not have his Staff of Power, and therefore does not gain a free point of Will each
turn.] 

-   
-   
-   

[Exhaustion (3+) -- During the turn that this power is in effect, Frodo must take a Courage test for each inch he wishes to move. If Frodo fails any of these Courage tests then he collapses and is immediately Prone. Sam may carry Frodo as a Heavy Object.Corruption (4+)
-- The Evil player rolls a D6 and compares it to Frodo's current Courage value. If the result is equal to or higher than Frodo's Courage value then Frodo's Courage is reduced by 1 for the remainder of the game. If Frodo's Courage is reduced to 0, he has been taken over by the Ring and the game
ends.(7_pdfcoffee.com_quest-of-the-ringbearerpdf-pdf-free_media/media/image90.jpeg){width="5.886805555555555in"
height="4.070138888888889in"}Lure of the Ring (5+) -- The Ring provokes
Gollum to attack, and he is placed in base contact with the Ringbearer. They will fight as normal during the Fight phase before Gollum disappears back into hiding. If Gollum is ever slain, this power can no longer be used.Teeming Hordes -- A seemingly endless tide of Orcs
is spewed forth from the Black Gate, with more constantly joining the
battle.

Each time a Mordor Orc model is slain, keep it to one side. At the end of each Evil Move phase, the Evil player may move any models kept aside in this manner onto the board from the Black Gate. 

Stand your Ground -- The free peoples must stand as one upon the hill if they are to have any chance of
survival.

Good models may not willingly move more than 12" away from the centre of the Black Gate
board.

Greatest of the Trolls -- The Troll Chieftain that duels with Aragorn is unlike the others of its race -- tougher, more powerful and far more deadly.

The Mordor Troll Chieftain gains the Fearless special rule and an additional point of Might, Will and
Fate.
