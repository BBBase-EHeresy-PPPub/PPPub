## EREBOR RECLAIMED

Thorin Oakenshield has reclaimed Erebor and ascended as King Under the Mountain. However, the missing Arkenstone drives him to desperation, resembling the sickness that once overtook his grandfather. Amidst his madness, Thorin refuses the Elves and Men their rightful share of the treasure, which leads Bilbo to hand the Arkenstone to Bard in an effort to force Thorin's hand. This act coincides with the arrival of Dáin Ironfoot and his army, leading to a significant battle outside Erebor, during which Thorin comes to his senses and leads his company into battle.
