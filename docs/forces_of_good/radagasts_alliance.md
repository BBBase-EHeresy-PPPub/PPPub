To change Beorn’s form, the controlling player may roll a D6 at the start of Beorn’s Move. On the roll of a 4+ (Might may be used to modify this roll), Beorn changes shape from a man into a bear (or vice-versa). Replace the Beorn model with the Beorn the Bear model (or vice-versa). Beorn can then continue with his move as normal, including making Charges. Beorn cannot change form if there is an enemy model in base contact with him.

## BEORN THE BEAR
*BEAR, MONSTER, INFANTRY, HERO*

| Mv | F  | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|----|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8" | 8/4+| 8 | 8 | 3 | 3 | 6 | * | * | * |

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Burly]
- [Fearless]
- [Resistant to Magic]
- [Terror]
- [Woodland Creature]
- **Crushing Strength (BRUTAL POWER ATTACK)**

If Beorn wins a Duel, instead of striking as normal, choose a losing model – that model immediately suffers a Strength 10 hit. If the To Wound roll is successful, the victim suffers another Strength 10 hit, and so on, until the victim is dead or Beorn fails to wound his victim.

- **Berserk (PASSIVE)**

Beorn the Bear must always Charge an enemy if he is able to. Additionally, Beorn may not use the Stand Fast! or Heroic Actions of other models, and other models may not use his, whilst he is in bear form.

- **Skin-changer (ACTIVE)**

To change Beorn’s form, the Good player may roll a D6 at the start of Beorn’s Move. On the roll of a 4+ (Might may be used to modify this roll), Beorn changes shape from a man into a bear (or vice-versa). Replace the Beorn model with the Beorn the Bear model (or vice-versa). Beorn can then continue with his move as normal, including making Charges. Beorn cannot change form if there is an enemy model in base contact with him.

*Beorn is a very unusual character, in that he can shift between being a man and a bear. When he alters form, replace him with the appropriate model. Also, when he changes, he adopts the appropriate profile and characteristics. Beorn’s Might, Will, Fate and Wounds remain unchanged when he changes form.*
