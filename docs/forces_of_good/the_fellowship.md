## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Frodo Baggins; Samwise Gamgee; Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin Took; Gandalf the Grey; Aragorn - Strider; Legolas Greenleaf; Gimli son of Gloin; Boromir of Gondor; Bill the Pony and Smeagol.

## ADDITIONAL RULES

Unlike normal warbands, a Fellowship warband is comprised entirely of Hero models. Additionally, a Fellowship warband that contains Samwise Gamgee may also contain Bill the Pony. If the warband only contains Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, then it may also include Smeagol.

## ARMY BONUS

**"You have my Sword"** - As long as Frodo is alive and on the table (or escapes the board in Scenarios where this applies), all models from The Fellowship army list gain the [Fearless] special rule. Additionally, a force that consists solely of models from The Fellowship army list will never be considered Broken if Frodo is alive and on the table (or escapes the board in Scenarios where this applies).
