## HALLS OF THRANDUIL

Deep within Mirkwood's gloom, the Halls of Thranduil stand as a testament to the Woodland Realm's isolation and self-sufficiency. Ruled by the Elvenking Thranduil, a proud and private monarch, the realm remains largely detached from the affairs of Middle-earth. Under the command of Thranduil's son, Legolas, the Palace Guard protects the kingdom from various threats, while the Mirkwood Rangers handle deeper forest dangers, keeping the realm safe from intruders and dark forces.

### ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm; Legolas Greenleaf, Prince of Mirkwood; Tauriel; Palace Guard Captains; Mirkwood Captains; Mirkwood Ranger Captains; Palace Guard; Mirkwood Elves; Mirkwood Cavalry; Mirkwood Rangers; Wood Elf Sentinels.

### ARMY BONUS

"The Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin. They are less wise, and more dangerous" — Mirkwood Rangers do not count towards the army's Bow Limit. Additionally, when within 3" of Thranduil, all related units gain +1 to their To Wound rolls when making Strikes.
