## ARMY OF LAKE-TOWN

Located on pillars atop Long Lake, Esgaroth, known as Lake-town, was built following the destruction of Dale as a precaution against the Dragon in the Lonely Mountain. Despite being descendants of the great city of Dale, the people of Lake-town lead impoverished lives under the governance of the greedy Master of Lake-town, supported by his untrustworthy councillor, Alfrid. The Lake-town Guard, led by Captain Braga, remains loyal to the Master for monetary gain but is prepared to defend their town when necessary.
