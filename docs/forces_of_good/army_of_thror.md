## ARMY OF THRÓR

In the days before Smaug the Terrible, Erebor was the greatest Dwarf kingdom, ruled by Thrór, the King Under the Mountain. The wealth of Erebor came from its gems and gold, crafted by unmatched Dwarf artisans. The armies, led by Thrór alongside his son Thráin and grandson Thorin, were formidable. Despite their strength, Thrór's greed led to his downfall when Smaug claimed Erebor. Following the loss of Erebor, Thrór's kin sought to reclaim Moria but were defeated, leading to Thrór's death and Thráin's disappearance. In this dire moment, Thorin rose to prominence, earning his name 'Oakenshield'.
