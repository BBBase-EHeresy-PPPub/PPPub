## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Bard the Bowman; Percy; Alfrid the Councillor; Bain, Son of Bard; Sigrid & Tilda; Hilda Bianca; Gandalf the Grey; Bilbo Baggins, Master Burglar; Lake-town Militia Captains and Lake-town Militia.

The profile for Alfrid the Councillor can be found on page 46. Alfrid the Councillor counts as an Independent Hero if taken as part of a Survivors of Lake-town army list.

The profile for Gandalf the Grey can be found on page 16. Gandalf the Grey counts as a Hero of Valour if taken as part of a Survivors of Lake-town army list.

### DESIGNER’S NOTE

In the films, following Smaug’s destruction of Lake-town, some former members of the Lake-town Guard survive and journey to Dale, joining the ranks of the Lake-town Militia. With this in mind, it is completely acceptable to use Lake-town Guard models in this army list as Lake-town Militia in order to add even more variety to your force.

## ARMY BONUS

“Any man who wants to give their last, follow me!" – Bard the Bowman’s Stand Fast! will affect other Laketown Hero models. Additionally, Bard the Bowman’s Saviour of Lake-town special rule has its range increased to 12" instead of 6".

### BARD THE BOWMAN [140 POINTS]
*MAN, LAKE-TOWN, INFANTRY, HERO — HERO OF LEGEND*

| Mv | F  | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 6" | 5/3+ | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 3 | 3 | 3 |

**WARGEAR**

- [Sword]
- [Great bow][Bow]

**HEROIC ACTIONS**

- [Heroic Resolve]
- [Heroic Accuracy]
- [Heroic Strike]
- [Heroic Strength]

**OPTIONS**

- Windlance: 75 points
- [Horse]: 10 points
- [Armour]: 5 points

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **Rapid Fire (ACTIVE)**

If Bard the Bowman hits a target with his great bow, he may take another shot at a target within 3" of it (it may even be the same target). If that shot is also a hit, he may shoot again – to a maximum of three shots in total.

- **The Black Arrow (ACTIVE)**

Once per game, Bard the Bowman can fire his Black Arrow instead of shooting the Windlance normally. If you choose to do so, declare that he is firing his Black Arrow before rolling To Hit. When shooting the Black Arrow, Bard the Bowman re-rolls a failed To Hit roll and any failed In The Way tests. Furthermore, do not roll on the Scatter table when firing the Black Arrow – a successful To Hit roll against a Battlefield target automatically counts as a Dead On! result.

- **Saviour of Lake-town (PASSIVE)**

Bard the Bowman’s Stand Fast! rule has a range of 6". Furthermore, Bain, Son of Bard; Percy; Hilda Bianca; Lake-town Militia Captains and Lake-town Militia within 6" of Bard the Bowman receive a +1 bonus to their Fight value and count as being in range of a banner.

---

**THE WINDLANCE**

| Siege Engine | Strength | Defence | Wounds |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:--:|
|Windlance | (10) | 10 | 3 |

The Windlance follows all of the rules for a Siege Engine with the Superior Construction upgrade, as described in the main rules manual.

The Windlance is a small Siege Engine and Bard the Bowman counts as the Siege Engine’s only crew. Note that this means that he cannot move the Windlance, though unlike normal crew, he can choose to move more than 6" away from it even if it has not yet been destroyed.

Provided that he is in base contact with the Windlance and is not Engaged in combat, Bard the Bowman can fire the Windlance every turn. Bard the Bowman may use his Might to influence To Hit, To Wound and Scatter table rolls made for the Windlance.

**Accurate** – When firing the Windlance at a Battlefield target, the shot only scatters 3" rather than 6".

### SIGRID & TILDA [30 POINTS FOR BOTH]
*WOMEN, LAKE-TOWN, INFANTRY, HERO - INDEPENDENT HERO*

Sigrid and Tilda are Bard’s daughters. Young and unaccustomed to matters of warfare, they have no place on a battlefield. As the Battle of the Five Armies rages on, both are placed in great peril, their presence spurring on both Bard and Bain to acts of great heroism and courage in order to protect the two young girls from harm.

#### SIGRID
| Mv | F | S | D | A | W | C | M | W | F |
|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6" | 2/4+ | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 2 |

|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

**Deployment Notes**:

Sigrid and Tilda may only be included in your army if it also includes Bard the Bowman or Bain, Son of Bard. Sigrid and Tilda may only be in either Bard the Bowman’s or Bain, Son of Bard’s warband, and not the warband of another Hero.

**WARGEAR**

- [Unarmed]

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **"Da! Down Here!" (PASSIVE)**

Bard the Bowman and Bain, Son of Bard receive a bonus of +1 to their Fight value if they are within 6" of either Sigrid or Tilda. If Bard the Bowman or Bain, Son of Bard are within 6" of both Sigrid and Tilda then Bard and/or Bain receive a bonus of +1 to their Fight value and may call a Heroic Combat each turn without spending Might.

- **Something to Fight for (ACTIVE)**

If either Sigrid or Tilda are slain, Bard the Bowman will automatically pass all Courage tests. Additionally, when Bard moves, he must Charge the model that killed his daughter if possible. If this is not possible, Bard must move as close as possible to the model that killed his daughter. Once the model that killed his daughter has been slain, Bard must move as fast as possible towards the nearest visible enemy model for the rest of the game, Charging if possible.

It is possible for two models to be the target of Bard’s rage if both Sigrid and Tilda have been slain. In this case, Bard will target the closest of these two models until it has been slain, following which he will immediately target the second model. Once both models have been slain, Bard must continue to move as fast as possible towards the nearest visible enemy model for the rest of the game, Charging if possible.
