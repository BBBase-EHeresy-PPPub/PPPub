[***- Bilbo Baggins, The Hobbit: An Unexpected
Journey***]

[[]{#bookmark4
.anchor}**INTRODUCTION**]

[*F*][*rom the
stalwart and hardy warriors and contraptions of the Iron Hills, to the
legions of Orcs, Trolls and other beasts that Azog marches upon The Lonely Mountain, the events of The Hobbit
encompassed numerous armies and peoples that would fight for control of Erebor, or see the line of Durin wiped
from Middle-earth and the mountain fall under the control of a dark power from deep within Dol
Guldur.*]

[*Welcome to The Armies of The Hobbit, the comprehensive guide to all of
your favourite armies and factions for both the forces of Good and the legions of Evil found within The Hobbit trilogy. The Armies of
The Hobbit is a companion to the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game, which you will need a copy of to get the most out of this
manual.*]

[**WHAT DOES THIS MANUAL
CONTAIN?**]

[**ARMY LISTS**]

[*Within these pages you will find all of the profiles for the Heroes and Warriors from The Hobbit, including their points values, stats, special rules and Heroic Tiers, all organised into 20 army lists! Ranging from the forces of Mirkwood that fight for the Elvenking, to the troglodyte inhabitants of the vile Goblin-town, there are army lists to represent almost every fighting force from The Hobbit. Each army list will contain all of the model profiles available to that list, that army list's Army Bonus, a selection of background detailing the history and battles surrounding that particular faction, and anything else that you may need to know in order to play with that particular
army.*]

[**ALLIES MATRIX**]

[*The Armies of The Hobbit also presents the full Allies Matrix for both Good and Evil, containing all of the army lists from both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. The full rules for each level of alliance (Historical, Convenient and Impossible), as well as all of the details for creating allies in your games, can also be found here.*]

[**NARRATIVE
SCENARIOS**]

[*Alongside all of the profiles and the Allies Matrix is a selection of 11 Narrative Play Scenarios. These Scenarios feature events and battles from across the history of Middle-earth, with a particular focus on the armies and factions present at the time of The Hobbit and those from the history of Middle-earth that directly relate to them. The broad spectrum of Narrative Play Scenarios means that almost every army list features within at least one Scenario in one way or another, giving collectors a chance to play a Narrative Scenario with their favourite faction, or to experience new armies and tactics.*]

[**WHAT ABOUT THE LORD OF THE
RINGS?**]

[*For fans of the models from The Lord of the Rings, all of the profiles, army lists, rules and Scenarios that focus on the characters and events from The Lord of the Rings are presented in The Armies of The Lord of the Rings rules manual. The Armies of The Lord of the Rings works in much the same way as this manual, and is fully compatible with the Middle-earth Strategy Battle
Game.*]

[[]{#bookmark18 .anchor}**THORIN'S
COMPANY**]

[*T*][*horin
Oakenshield's search for his father led
him*]

[*to a chance encounter with the Grey Wizard. In the Prancing Pony, Gandalf set Thorin upon a path for redemption, to march upon Erebor and retake his homeland. Thorin sets off to attempt to rally the seven Dwarf armies to his cause, whilst Gandalf heads to The Shire in search of a
burglar.*]

[*This search led Gandalf to Bag End, only to be greeted by Bilbo
Baggins as if he were selling buttons at the door. The reluctant Hobbit was
soon subjected to the Dwarves descending upon his quiet home. Although he was unaware of it at the time, Bilbo would join these Dwarves in their quest to reclaim The Lonely Mountain and form the Company of Thorin Oakenshield.*]

[*Alongside Thorin stood his nephews, KÃ­li and FÃ­li. Young and brash by
Dwarven standards, these brothers had much to learn about the workings of the
world. Balin, and his brother Dwalin, had fought alongside Thorin since the
glory days of Erebor. They were present for the coming of Smaug and the loss of
Erebor, and fought at the battle of Azanulbizar against the armies of the Pale
Orc.*]

[*Bifur, Bofur and Bombur all joined the company from their home in the Blue Mountains. A jolly and light-hearted Dwarf, Bofur served the company well by raising the spirits of those around him, and formed a close bond with Bilbo. Bifur, on the other hand, was unable to speak the common tongue at all. This was entirely due to the jagged axe-blade that jutted from his skull. Bombur was easily the largest of the
Dwarves â€” and it was he who all but emptied Bilbo's pantry upon the Dwarves' arrival at Bag End.*]

[*The brothers Ori, Nori and Dori, who hailed from the Blue Mountains, also joined Thorin's Company. Dori was the oldest of the three and would spend most of his time trying to keep his two brothers out of trouble, for Nori was a renowned troublemaker and pickpocket, whilst Ori was the youngest of the company. Ã“in and GlÃ³in were the final members of the company, both unable to resist the lure of potential treasure.*]

[*It was this legendary band of unlikely heroes that would journey
through Goblin tunnels, spider-infested forests and a town atop a lake as they
set out to reclaim
Erebor.*]

[**ARMY
COMPOSITION**]

[*This army may include: Thorin Oakenshield; Balin the Dwarf; Dwalin the Dwarf; KÃ­li the Dwarf; FÃ­li the Dwarf; Bifur the Dwarf; Bofur the Dwarf; Bombur the Dwarf; Ori the Dwarf; Nori the Dwarf; Dori the Dwarf; Ã“in the Dwarf; GlÃ³in the
Dwarf;*]

[*Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the
Grey.*]

[**ADDITIONAL
RULES**]

[*A Thorin's Company warband is always a single warband made up entirely of Heroes, and can even extend beyond the normal model limits for a warband. The Hero with the highest Heroic Tier is treated as being the warband's
captain.*]

[***ARMY BONUS***]

[*"I would take each and every one of these Dwarves over an army from the Iron Hills, for when I called upon them, they answered" â€” Models from this army list may re-roll To Wound rolls of a 1 whilst within 3" of Thorin Oakenshield.*]

[*Thorin Oakenshield is the heir to the throne of Erebor, a Dwarf of
noble heritage and great courage. In the long years following the
Dwarves' exile from their homeland, Thorin led his people well, forging a new home for them
in the Blue Mountains. However, a chance meeting with Gandalf the Grey
has set Thorin upon a path to take back Erebor and reclaim his home. This
task will take every ounce of the Dwarf prince's skill, strength and
courage to accomplish, as well as no small amount of help from his kin and one
unsuspecting
burglar!*]

Oakenshield in battle.*]

[*The younger of Thorin's nephews, KÃ­li is still a skilled fighter and a valuable member of Thorin's Company. His noble lineage has provided him with great swordsmanship, as well as making him a crack shot with a bow. However, his best quality is his unwavering loyalty to his family, for KÃ­li will do anything within his power to protect his brother and uncle.*]

[*Older brother to KÃ­li, FÃ­li is every bit his brother's equal. However, where his brother is dark, he is fair. FÃ­li's quick wits are matched only by the speed of his blades â€” many an Orc has fallen foul of the swiftness in which FÃ­li throws his axes and even more have failed to match the young Dwarf's skill in combat. Like his brother, FÃ­li is fiercely loyal to Thorin, and is willing to risk everything for
him.*]

[[]{#bookmark133 .anchor}**ARMY OF
THRÃ“R**]

[*I*][*n the days
before the coming of Smaug the Terrible, Erebor was the greatest Dwarf kingdom in Middle-earth, for Erebor was the stronghold of ThrÃ³r, the mightiest of the Dwarf lords and King Under the Mountain. The wealth of the mountain was in the gems hewn from its rock and the seams of gold that ran like veins through its stone, the skill of the Dwarves who lived there was unequalled in the fashioning of items of great beauty from diamond, emerald, ruby and
sapphire.*]

[*The great armies of Erebor were renowned throughout Middle-earth for their martial prowess, and the mighty leaders that captained them. Trained from an early age, the warriors of Erebor were the main bulk of ThrÃ³r's army. Each was of exceptional skill and accustomed to the ways of war. The elite forces of Erebor were made of the Grim Hammers. These stalwart fighters were clad in thick-plated armour and bore large pick-hammers, the weapons for which they were
named.*]

[*At the head of the army stood the King himself. ThrÃ³r was a powerful lord, with a skill in battle befitting a Dwarf lord of his standing. At his side stood his son, ThrÃ¡in, and his grandson, Thorin. ThrÃ¡in was a battle-hardened veteran who bore the physical scars of the wars he had fought, scars that paled in comparison to the marks that he
left*]

[*upon his enemies. Thorin was a Dwarf of yet-untapped potential, a potential that would, in the coming years, come to fruition. It was under the rule of ThrÃ³r's line that Erebor flourished and was prosperous.*]

[*However, this time of prosperity would not last. For ThrÃ³r's love of gold had become too fierce and a sickness had begun to take over his mind. It wasn't long thereafter that ThrÃ³r's treasure hoard tempted fate. For Smaug, a great Fire-drake from the north, rained down destruction upon the kingdom of Erebor, slaughtering its people and claiming the mountain for himself. The Dwarves of Erebor were now homeless, and forced to roam Middle-earth in search of a new place to call their own.*]

[*Following Erebor's loss, ThrÃ³r's people set out to reclaim the lost kingdom of Moria from the clutches of the Orcs that resided within its huge stone halls. It was at the fateful battle of Azanulbizar that ThrÃ³r fell, beheaded by the Pale Orc, Azog. Driven mad with grief, ThrÃ¡in rushed into the fray, only to be lost and presumed fallen like his father. It was in the midst of this tide of death that Thorin rose to the destiny he was meant for. With the use of an oaken branch, Thorin defeated Azog in combat â€” forever earning himself the moniker of 'Oakenshield'.*]

brought with it the Dragon-sickness known to plague the line of Durin, and
ultimately, the attentions of the great Fire-drake, Smaug, who wrought
fiery ruin upon the Dwarven King's hold. Even in the years of his exile from The Lonely
Mountain, however, ThrÃ³r remained a powerful lord, and the armies of
the Dwarves joined him at the ill-fated Battle of

HILLS**]

[*T*][*he Iron Hills
are unusual among the great Dwarf holds, in that their fame stems neither from their wealth nor the glory of their artifices and the labour that has crafted them. Instead, the Iron Hills are known for a single, simple accolade: their military might. At the time of the Battle of the Five Armies, the army of the Iron Hills is one of the most disciplined and experienced fighting forces in Middle-earth, and has fought relentlessly since the tragic victory of Durin's Folk at the Battle of
Azanulbizar.*]

[*DÃ¡in Ironfoot is the undisputed master of the Iron Hills, a ferocious warrior-lord who won his reputation in battle against Azog's Legions as a youth, and has lost none of his savagery in the many years since. Having tasted the bitterest of sacrifices on the slopes of the Dimrill Dale, DÃ¡in and his warriors have used the decades that followed to hone their skills, crushing every Orc and Goblin army they encounter. This warlike lifestyle has forged the Iron Hills Dwarves into an implacable and remorseless foe, indomitable in battle and unflinching even against horrendous
odds.*]

[*They have learned to adapt to overcome their weaknesses, harnessing beasts of burden to speed their finest warriors into battle, and innovating powerful war machines to protect their ranks. For all their savvy, however, the undeniable truth of warfare against the Dwarves of the Iron Hills is that death awaits their foes at the shieldwall. In
the press of combat, their iron-edged shields present an immovable bulwark, through which barbed spears offer death to the enemy. At a barked word from their captains, these veteran Khazad execute precise orders, even under the most duress, sure in the knowledge that there is no foe that they cannot
overcome.*]

[*Behind their intense martial skill and discipline lies the fiery wrath
of a Dwarf at war, for the Iron Hills Dwarves honour the bonds of kin above all else. It is for this purpose that DÃ¡in and his warriors march on
Erebor, for DÃ¡in is Thorin's cousin by blood and friend by choice. When the
ravens reached the Lord of the Iron Hills, with the message that Erebor was once again in the hands of the Dwarves, no time was lost...the Iron
Hills would aid their kin, and woe-betide any who stood in their
path.*]

across Middle-earth for his unrivalled skill in battle and his fearsome temper.
DÃ¡in charges into battle upon his great war boar and wields a massive
Dwarven hammer which he uses to bludgeon and crush those Orcs foolish enough to
stand in his way. Having led the Dwarves of the Iron Hills in countless

[Burly, Fearless.]

[ ]

[*Lord of the Iron Hills â€” DÃ¡in is the undisputed Lord of the Iron Hills, and as such his stoic warriors will follow him into any
battle without question.*]

[*Whilst DÃ¡in Ironfoot, Lord of the Iron Hills is alive on the battlefield, all Iron Hills Dwarf models within 12" of DÃ¡in automatically pass all Courage tests they are required to
make.*]

[*Fiery Temper â€” DÃ¡in's temper is so fierce that his fury could be his downfall.*]

[*As soon as DÃ¡in Ironfoot, Lord of the Iron Hills kills an enemy model, for the rest of the game, if DÃ¡in is in range to Charge, he must do so if he is able
to.*]

[*Fearsome Charge â€” The sight of DÃ¡in charging into battle is a terrifying sight to behold and not a challenge that many would face
willingly.*]

[*In a turn that DÃ¡in Ironfoot, Lord of the Iron Hills Charges into combat, he causes Terror until the end of the
turn.*]

[*Headbutt â€” DÃ¡in's thick skull is just as likely to knock down an enemy as his
hammer.*]

[*If DÃ¡in Ironfoot, Lord of the Iron Hills wins a Duel roll but fails
to slay his opponent, select one enemy Man-sized (or smaller) model in the fight and roll a D6. On a 5+, DÃ¡in will headbutt that model and it will be Knocked to the
Ground.*]

bickering, as most Dwarves do, these close companions have travelled far
and wide beyond their mountain home, and more than once have found themselves embroiled
in a fight to aid those Free Peoples who need it most. The rash and
daring MÃºrin has developed great skill with his sword, KalazÃ¢l, and Sauron's
minions of all kinds have felt its cutting blade. In contrast DrÃ¡r is a
calm and collected fellow, preferring instead to arm himself with a bow â€” a

[**SPECIAL RULES**]

[*Reliable â€” The Dwarves that crew these war machines are experts at hitting their desired
targets.*]

[*The Iron Hills Ballista always counts as declaring a Heroic Shoot â€” there is no need to spend Might. Additionally, the Ballista follows the rules for Volley Fire. When the Ballista hits a target, place a marker under the centre of the target model. Draw a line from the centre of the Ballista to the centre of the marker. Shooting attacks that are Strength 6 or less cannot target any model within 3" of that line for the remainder of the turn. Additionally, shooting attacks that are Strength 6 or less cannot be made if they cross the line at any point. If a shooting attack that is Strength 7 or more targets a model that is either within 3" of the line, or the shot crosses the line, roll a D6. On the roll of a 5+, the shooting attack is prevented. At the end of the turn, remove any marker placed due to this special
rule.*]

[*Tremendous Impact â€” The bolts from these deadly weapons crash into the foe with tremendous force, gouging out huge chunks of land, and the bodies of those unlucky enough to get in their way are
sent sprawling to the
ground.*]

[If an Iron Hills Ballista scores a hit against a Battlefield Target, all Man-sized (or smaller) models within 2" are Knocked to the Ground. Cavalry models within 2" must take a Thrown Rider test. Additionally, any model within 2" also suffers a Strength 4
hit.]

[When firing an Iron Hills Ballista at a target, the shot will only scatter 3", rather than 6". Furthermore, the Iron Hills Crew may re-roll 1s to hit.]

**SPECIAL RULES**

Fearless, Monstrous Charge.

Dwarven Crew â€” *The Iron Hills Chariot has four crew members. As crew members are slain, other Iron Hills Dwarves move to take their place atop the Chariot.*

Any Iron Hills Dwarf Warrior may replace a slain crew member by ending their Move phase in base contact with the Chariot. Any Iron Hills Dwarf Warrior who joins the Chariot immediately drops their spear, shield, mattock, crossbow or banner.

Should the driver be killed, another Iron Hills Dwarf on the Chariot immediately takes their place. Any Chariot that has all of its crew slain is removed as a casualty.

Rapid Fire Bolt Thrower â€” *Attached to the Chariot is a bolt thrower. Capable of firing multiple shots in quick succession, this
weapon makes the Chariot even more deadly.*

Any Iron Hills Dwarf, that is not the driver, may man the rapid fire bolt thrower. This is a crossbow that fires D6 shots per turn. The bolt thrower only has a limited field of fire of 45Ëš to its left or right. The Chariot may still fire even if it has moved its full distance that turn. Additionally, the Chariot does not suffer the -1 penalty for moving and shooting.

The Chariot may still shoot even if Engaged in combat and does not need an In The Way test for models Engaged with it. Each shot may target a different enemy. If it does this, then the Dwarf operating the rapid fire bolt thrower may not add its Attacks or Fight value to the Duel roll, and may not make Strikes, in the following Fight phase.

Chariot Charge â€” *Iron Hills Chariots charge forward with deadly, yet unwieldy, force.*

The Iron Hills Chariot is an unusual model and moves in the following way:

-   At the start of the Move phase, the controlling player may pivot     the Chariot up to 45Âº. When pivoting, the Chariot may touch     models or terrain. In the case of models, move them out of the     way by the shortest route possible. In the case of terrain, move     the Chariot away just enough to complete its pivot.

-   The Chariot may then move up to 4" in a straight line.

-   If it has moved a full 4", it may pivot a further 45Âº.

-   The Chariot may then move up to a further 4" in a straight line.

-   When the Chariot moves, it ignores enemy models' Control     Zones. Any models the Chariot comes into contact with     whilst moving (not pivoting) will suffer three Strength 6 hits.     If the model is slain then the Chariot may continue with its     movement. Cavalry models suffer three hits on both the rider     and the mount. If the rider survives but the mount is slain, the     rider is thrown and, after testing on the Thrown Rider chart, is     placed in base contact with the Chariot. Might may not be used     to affect the result of these hits. A Chariot that is affected by a     Heroic March may still inflict these hits as normal.

-   If the model the Chariot Charged survives, the Chariot will still     gain the benefits of its Monstrous Charge special rule.

-   The Chariot may instead choose to forego its movement in order     to pivot to face any direction. If a Chariot is moved by an enemy     model, it may not pivot in this way.

The Chariot in Combat â€” *The platform upon which the crew stands is sturdy enough for them to fight from.*

The Chariot counts as one model in a fight. Any surviving crew member that is not driving the Chariot adds their Attacks to the Duel roll. Additionally, the Chariot will also use the highest Fight value of any Dwarf that is on the Chariot (including the driver). No model that is riding on an Iron Hills Chariot can declare a Heroic Combat.

If beaten, any model wishing to Strike the crew must roll to see if they hit the crew or the Chariot. To do this, roll a D6 for each Strike. On a 4+, the Strike hits the crew member of the attacker's choice â€” anything else hits the Chariot.

If the Chariot loses the Fight, it does not Back Away. It also never counts as Trapped. If the Chariot is slain, then the crew inside are lost â€” remove the model as a casualty.

Large War Machine â€” On a turn in which the Iron Hills Chariot Charges, it gains the Extra Attack and Knock to the Ground bonuses as if it was a Cavalry model. The Iron

Hills Chariot still gets these bonuses even if it charges a Cavalry model. When the Chariot is hit by a shooting attack, the shooter must take an In The Way test to determine if the Chariot or the crew are hit. On a 1-4, the Chariot has been hit and on a 5-6, it hits the Dwarf closest to the shooter. The Chariot may not make Jump, Climb, Leap or Swim tests, and may not lie down or defend barriers. It may not enter difficult terrain other than shallow water features (including swamps, rivers, etc.), which it is completely unimpeded by. The Chariot cannot be Barged, Hurled or knocked Prone for any reason.

The Chariot and Magic 2522 â€” Models with Magical Powers can use them on the Chariot, selecting either the Chariot itself or one of the crew members as the target. Magical Powers that affect multiple targets will automatically affect both the Chariot and its crew, if in range of the model. Only by affecting the Driver will a Magical Power such as Transfix or Compel impede the Chariot's movement (thereby causing it to remain stationary or take a move as described by the Magical Power). Finally, Magical Powers such as Sorcerous Blast, Nature's Wrath and Call Winds will not move the Chariot or knock it Prone, although they will still inflict any damage as detailed in the Magical Power's description.

Iron Hills Captain â€” If this upgrade is taken for the Chariot, then an Iron Hills Captain will replace the driver. The Iron Hills Captain will have all of the usual wargear and special rules that an Iron Hills Captain would normally possess whilst riding the Chariot (see page 29). The Chariot counts as a Hero for the Iron Hills army list and may be the army leader. If the Iron Hills Captain is taken, replace the Warrior keyword with Hero whilst the Captain remains alive.

![](../media/3_Middle-earth_-_The_Armies_of_The_Hobbit_media/image57.jpeg)

**CHAMPIONS OF EREBOR AS CREW: DESIGNER'S NOTE**

Champions of Erebor â€” If this upgrade is taken for the Chariot, then
instead of being crewed by four Iron Hills Dwarves, it is crewed by Balin the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Dwalin the Dwarf,
Champion of Erebor; Kili the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor and Fili the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor. If the Champions of
Erebor are taken, replace the Warrior keyword with Hero.

The Chariot is also subject to the following exceptions:

-   Balin must always be the driver. Should Balin the Dwarf,     Champion of Erebor be slain, another Dwarf on the Chariot     immediately takes his place. Should all the Dwarves be slain,     then the Chariot is removed as a casualty. If the Chariot is     slain, the Dwarves take a Thrown Rider test instead.

-   The Dwarves who ride the Chariot have all of their usual     wargear and special rules (see pages 38-39) whilst riding     in the Chariot.

-   Dwalin must always man the rapid fire bolt thrower     until he is slain.

-   Unlike other Iron Hills Chariots, only Balin, Dwalin, Kili and     Fili may ride this Chariot.

-   Magical Powers may be directed at the Dwarves individually,     in which case they will Resist and be affected individually     with no impact on each other.

-   In combat, the Chariot is very unusual in that a Duel can     effectively have multiple models on both sides of the Fight.     When making a Duel roll, make sure to roll each Dwarf's     attacks separately for the purpose of using Might points.     Additionally, each Dwarf may decide to use Special Strikes. If     Kili or Fili use the Feint Special Strike, then the Fight values     of all of the crew and the Chariot itself will be reduced by D3.     If Kili or Fili use the Stab Special Strike, then only they will     be affected. If Dwalin uses the Piercing Strike Special Strike     then only his Strength and Defence will be affected.

-   This version of the Chariot counts as four models for the     purpose of working out Break points.

-   The Chariot counts as a Hero for the Erebor Reclaimed     army list and may be the army leader. It may not, however,     lead a warband. If the Chariot is chosen as the leader of your     army, then Balin is the leader for all intents and purposes.

**IRON HILLS CHARIOT - MOVEMENT AND SHOOTING TEMPLATE**

![](../media/3_Middle-earth_-_The_Armies_of_The_Hobbit_media/image59.jpeg)

On this page is a template for use with your Iron Hills Chariot.

It is ideal for measuring the angle for pivoting your Iron Hills Chariot during its movement, and for working out which enemy models are within the rapid fire bolt thrower's field of fire.

Feel free to print out this page for your own personal use or simply use the template on screen.

To use this template, place the corner marked X over the centre of the rapid fire bolt thrower with the dotted line running along the pole of the Chariot (the long wood and metal shaft running between and connecting the goats).

When pivoting the Chariot, keep the template still and pivot the Chariot about point X so that the pole is now facing up to 45Âº to either the left or the right, as shown by the template.

When firing the rapid fire bolt thrower, place the template as described above. This is the rapid fire bolt thrower's field of fire.

[]{#bookmark283 .anchor}**EREBOR RECLAIMED**

*Thorin Oakenshield has fulfilled his quest to The Lonely*

*Mountain, reclaiming his birthright â€” and now he sits upon the throne of Erebor as King Under the Mountain. However, all is not well within the mountain's walls. For the Arkenstone is still seemingly missing, driving Thorin into near-madness in order to find the King's jewel. As his desperation grows, a sickness begins to seep into Thorin's mind â€” the same sickness that drove his grandfather to madness many years before.*

*Amidst his search for the Arkenstone, Thorin is confronted by a host
of Elves and Men at his gates, demanding the share of the treasure that
was pledged to them. However, Thorin will not be swayed and refuses that which was promised â€” tarnishing his word, and the word of the Hobbit who spoke on his behalf. Appalled with what he has witnessed, Bilbo
gifts the Arkenstone to Bard as a token to make Thorin honour his word.*

*Confronted once more by the armies of Elves and Men, Thorin sends a raven with a message calling for aid to his cousin, DÃ¡in. The sound of iron-shod boots heralds the arrival of DÃ¡in Ironfoot and his army of*

*hardy Iron Hills Dwarves, as they come to the aid of their king. As
the ranks of Elves and Dwarves clash in a bloody melee, Thorin retreats back into Erebor to continue his search for the Arkenstone, an action that the members of the company do not receive well.*

*Within the halls of Erebor, Thorin eventually realises what he has become. Casting aside the sickness that had poisoned his mind, Thorin rallies his companions and readies them for war. With the Battle of the Five Armies raging on outside of Erebor's gates, Thorin leads his company's charge into the fray. The sight of the charge of the
champions of Erebor rallies the surviving Iron Hills Dwarves to their king.*

*The company of Thorin Oakenshield now fights alongside the Dwarves of the Iron Hills, locked in mortal combat with the foul beings of Azog's legions. Such is the courage that Thorin has renewed in his kin that they will all fight with reinvigorated strength in defence of the mountain.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Thorin Oakenshield, King Under the Mountain; Balin the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Dwalin the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; KÃ­li the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; FÃ­li the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Bifur the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Bofur the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Bombur the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Ori the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Nori the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Dori the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; Ã“in the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; GlÃ³in the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor; DÃ¡in Ironfoot, Lord of the Iron Hills; Iron Hills Captains; Iron Hills Dwar ves and Iron Hills Goat Riders.

**ADDITIONAL RULES**

**DWARF, EREBOR, INFANTRY, HERO â€” HERO OF LEGEND**

*The Lonely Mountain has been reclaimed; Thorin Oakenshield now sits
upon the throne of Erebor. Yet despite this great triumph, a sickness
lies upon the great treasure hoard of his people; the same sickness that infected the
High King, ThrÃ³r, has now befallen his grandson. However, with the
Battle of the Five Armies raging outside the gates of Erebor, Thorin remembers that
true wealth in life does not lie with gold, but with honour and standing
with his friends. Proving that he truly is the king that his kin had always
believed in, Thorin now charges forth from the gates of Erebor to fulfil
the duty of the King Under the Mountain. Finally embroiled in mortal combat with Azog,
Thorin Oakenshield's finest hour will ultimately be his last.*

*Having survived Smaug's wrath, Bifur now turns his fury to the legions of Orcs that march upon Erebor, the axe-blade lodged in his skull having both scarred him and rendered him unable to speak the common tongue.

It could leave him paralysed, or it may allow him to finally communicate with those other than his kin, a skill that would prove invaluable in the Battle of the Five Armies.*

If Bifur the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor wins a fight, he may choose to headbutt his enemy with the axe-blade embedded in his skull. Instead of

[]{#bookmark346 .anchor}**ARMY OF LAKE-TOWN**

*Propped up on pillars atop the Long Lake lies the humble fishing town of Esgaroth, more commonly k nown as Lake-town, built upon the waters following the destruction of Dale as a safety measure against the Dragon that now lies within the Lonely Mountain. Those that dwell in Lake-town live an impoverished life, eeking out a meagre existence. For although the inhabitants of Lake-town are descended from the great city of Dale, the wealth of that once powerful kingdom has long since been lost.*

*Any wealth that may exist within the boundaries of Esgaroth is swiftly collected by the Master of Lake-town, who is not above fabricating 'ancient laws' in order to increase his standing. For the Master is a greedy man who will do anything to protect his great wealth, a way of being that has led the people of Lake-town to refer to him as 'Old Moneybags'. Constantly at the Master's side is the cowardly Alfrid, councillor to the Master â€” a scheming and untrustworthy man whose counsel can only be trusted upon to serve himself, and who undoubtedly shares the Master's love of gold.*

*In such a poor area as Esgaroth, wealth commands power and as such the Lake-town Guard will readily serve the one who holds the purse-strings â€” in this case the Master â€” and they will do his
bidding in order to receive a cut of his wealth. Braga, the Captain of the Guard, ensures that the Master stays in power and that troublemakers are dealt with in an appropriate fashion, so long as he is paid well for his services.*

*Although Lake-town is not used to the ways of war, having not been involved in one for many a year, they still keep a ready guard who, whilst corrupt, will still defend their town should the need arise.
These guards are trained with sword, spear and bow and, whilst much of the skill of Dale has been lost, they are able to fight and defend their
town. However, among those that live in Esgaroth, there are some who are directly descended from the people, and even lords, of Dale. It is
these Men that will take up the defence of Esgaroth and lead her guard in her greatest hour of need, in order to protect that which they hold
dear against the oncoming fury of a Dragon enraged.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Bard the Bowman; The Master of Lake- town; Alfrid the Councilor; Braga, Captain of the Guard; Bain, Son of Bard; Sigrid & Tilda; Lake-town Guard Captains and Lake-town Guard.

In truth, Alfrid's counsel can only really be relied on to serve himself.*

Alfrid can choose to expend any number of Will points at the start of
the Priority phase, before any dice are rolled. For each point of Will he
expends, nominate a single friendly Lake-town Hero model within 6" and roll a
D6. For each roll of a 2+, the nominated Lake-town Hero gains a point of Might.
On the roll of a 1, however, the nominated Lake-town Hero instead loses a
point of Might and Alfrid gains a point of Might. Might gained in this way can
take the chosen Lake-town Hero model's store of Might points beyond its initial
level.

*First in command of the Lake-town Guard, Braga is a self-important man who has become accustomed to living a higher quality of life than the men he commands.

Many of the people of Esgaroth suffered the same fate as the inhabitants of Dale, and even the wealth of the Master was not enough to save him from sharing the same demise as the town he had ruled over, as he was crushed by Smaug's carcass as it crashed into the lake.*

*Those that survived the Dragon's wrath were homeless and left with nothing, prepared to turn upon Alfrid in revenge for what they endured under the rule of the Master. Bard the Dragon Slayer's intervention, however, prevented further bloodshed, an act that would herald him as the new lord, following in his ancestors' footsteps.*

Seeing their leaders fight is enough to
rally the militia and inspire them to charge into the fray again and again, desperate to not let a second home fall in such a short space of time.*

*It is in desperate times like these where some will rise to a
potential they never knew they could. Formerly a bargeman, Bard finally rises to the position he was always destined to hold as he leads his people against the onslaught of Gundabad Orcs that swarm Dale's streets. Percy, the porter in Lake-town, rises to become second-in-command under Bard's leadership, leading the archers in defence of the city.
Even a humble fisher-wife, Hilda-Bianca, plays her part, rallying the old, women and wounded to fight alongside the men for their survival.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Bard the Bowman; Percy; Alfrid the Councillor; Bain, Son of Bard; Sigrid & Tilda; Hilda Bianca;

Gandalf the Grey; Bilbo Baggins, Master Burglar; Lake-town Militia Captains and Lake-town Militia.

The profile for Alfrid the Councillor can be found on page 46. Alfrid the Councillor counts as an Independent Hero if taken as part of a Survivors of Lake-town army list.

The profile for Gandalf the Grey can be found on page 16. Gandalf the Grey counts as a Hero of Valour if taken as part of a Survivors of Lake-town army list.

**DESIGNER'S NOTE:**

In the films, following Smaug's destruction of Lake-town, some former members of the Lake-town Guard survive and journey to Dale, joining the ranks of the Lake-town Militia. With this in mind, it is completely acceptable to use Lake-town Guard models in this army list as Lake-town Militia in order to add even more variety to your force.

**ARMY BONUS**

"Any man who wants to give their last, follow me!" â€” Bard the Bowman's Stand Fast! will affect other Lake- town Hero models. Additionally, Bard the Bowman's Saviour of Lake-town special rule has its range increased to 12" instead of 6".

*Descended from the noble lords of Dale, Bard is the descendant of Girion and heir to the rule of Dale. Following the slaying of the Dragon, Smaug, Bard took up his rightful place as the leader of the Men of the Lake. Proving to be as noble a leader as his ancestors, Bard journeys to Erebor to seek fair settlement from the Dwarves in order to rebuild the homes of his people. However, Bard finds himself thrust into the middle of a battle against Azog's legions. Proving his skill in combat, Bard's efforts at the Battle of the Five Armies inspires his followers to draw on reserves of courage that only a handful knew they possessed.*

**SPECIAL RULES**

Rapid Fire â€” *Few, whether Men or otherwise, possess Bard the Bowman's
skill with a bow.*

If Bard the Bowman hits a target with his great bow, he may take another
shot at a target within 3" of it (it may even be the same target). If that
shot is also a hit, he may shoot again â€” to a maximum of three shots in total.

The Black Arrow â€” *Bard the Bowman somehow knew that one day it would be his destiny to fire this arrow and avenge his fallen ancestor.*

Once per game, Bard the Bowman can fire his Black Arrow instead of
shooting the Windlance normally. If you choose to do so, declare that he is
firing his Black Arrow before rolling To Hit. When shooting the Black Arrow, Bard the Bowman re-rolls a failed To Hit roll and any failed In The Way
tests. Furthermore, do not roll on the Scatter table when firing the Black
Arrow â€” a successful To Hit roll against a Battlefield target automatically counts
as a Dead On! result.

Saviour of Lake-town â€” *By felling Smaug, Bard the Bowman earns the undying loyalty and respect of his people.*

Bard the Bowman's Stand Fast! rule has a range of 6". Furthermore,
Bain, Son of Bard; Percy; Hilda Bianca; Lake-town Militia Captains and
Lake-town Militia within 6" of Bard the Bowman receive a +1 bonus to their Fight
value and count as being in range of a banner.

Windlance, though unlike normal crew, he can choose to move more than
6" away from it even if it has not yet been destroyed.

Provided that he is in base contact with the Windlance and is not
Engaged in combat, Bard the Bowman can fire the Windlance every turn. Bard the Bowman may use his Might to influence To Hit, To Wound and Scatter
table rolls made for the Windlance.

Accurate â€” When firing the Windlance at a Battlefield target, the shot
only scatters 3" rather than 6".

"Da! Down Here!" â€” *Bard and Bain will stop at nothing to protect their family.*

Bard the Bowman and Bain, Son of Bard receive a bonus of +1 to their Fight value if they are within 6" of either Sigrid or Tilda. If Bard the Bowman or Bain, Son of Bard are within 6" of both Sigrid and Tilda then Bard and/or Bain receive a bonus of +1 to their Fight value and may call a Heroic Combat each turn without spending Might.

Something to Fight for â€” *Bard will protect his daughters above all else. Should Sigrid or Tilda fall, Bard will be driven mad
with grief.*

If either Sigrid or Tilda are slain, Bard the Bowman will automatically pass all Courage tests. Additionally, when Bard moves, he must Charge the model that killed his daughter if possible. If this is not possible, Bard must move as close as possible to the model that killed his daughter. Once the model that killed his daughter has been slain, Bard must move as fast as possible towards the nearest visible enemy model for the rest of the game, Charging if possible.

It is possible for two models to be the target of Bard's rage if both Sigrid and Tilda have been slain. In this case, Bard will target the closest of these two models until it has been slain, following which he will immediately target the second model. Once both models have been slain, Bard must continue to move as fast as possible towards the nearest visible enemy model for the rest of the game, Charging if possible.

of a priceless Mithril shirt for his courage and loyalty. However, upon
Thorin's discovery that Bilbo had kept the Arkenstone from him, the Hobbit was
cast out from Erebor. Not to be deterred by the Dwarf's actions, Bilbo
will be re-united with Thorin Oakenshield before the end.*

[]{#bookmark491 .anchor}**GARRISON OF DALE**

*Before the coming of Smaug, Dale was a prosperous city of Men, a beacon for all trade in the north, and her markets were famed for the quality of the goods sold upon her streets. For Dale lived in the shadow of the great kingdom of Erebor, and for many years had been allies with the Dwarves that dwelled there, sharing in the wealth of the mountain.*

*This alliance with the Dwarves allowed for the knights of Dale to be armed with the finest of iron-forged weapons and equipped with exquisitely fashioned shields and armour. Although peace had prevailed in Dale for many years, her armies were still well-prepared to march to war should the need arise. The knights of Dale were highly skilled in
the art of sword fighting and many an enemy found themselves on the wrong end of a swift blow from their blades.*

*However, it is in the use of bow and arrow where the armies of Dale really made a name for themselves. Championed as being among the*

*finest bowmen the race of Men had to offer, the archers of Dale's
armies felled countless foes upon the field of battle with pinpoint accuracy,
a skill that can still be found in the ancestors of the once great city,
and one that will prove useful in the years to come.*

*At the time of Smaug's coming, Girion was the lord of Dale and was tasked with her defence. As Smaug destroyed the city, Girion made his
way to the Dwarven Windlance deployed on the rooftops. Firing Black Arrow after Black Arrow at the great beast, Girion hit his mark time and time again. His shots were unable to pierce the creature's thick hide,
however, and although he led his warriors valiantly against the Dragon, Girion ultimately suffered the same fate as many of those he had fought to
protect. As the city became engulfed in flame, her armies were destroyed and
those that survived scattered to avoid suffering the same fate. Although not
the first injustice her people had to endure, it was certainly the greatest
that Dale had ever been forced to undergo.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Girion, Lord of Dale; Captains of Dale and Warriors of Dale.

**ARMY BONUS**

"Girion, lord of the city, rallied his bowmen to fire upon the beast." â€” Captains of Dale and Warriors of Dale have their Shoot value improved to 3+.

doomed the moment that Smaug set upon the city. However, before he met
his terrible fate, Girion left a mark upon the beast, loosening the scale that would
one day prove to be its undoing.*

*The Elves are the oldest, wisest and most skillful of all the races in Middle-earth. They are immortal beings, many of whom have been alive since the early years of the First Age. The mighty lords who command the forces of the Elves are formidable leaders and, when the Elves unite beneath their glittering banners, there are few who can stand against their might.*

*Throughout the early years of the Second Age, the Elves inhabited much
of western Middle-earth. There within their great cities they prospered,
free of the shadow of Morgoth. But their prosperity would dwindle. For it
was the Elven smith Celebrimbor who forged the great rings of power,
teaching Sauron his craft. This was an act that would doom the lands of Middle-earth to fall before Sauron's rage, for he tricked the Elven smith and
in secret forged The One Ring, cementing himself as the Dark Lord. Using his dominion over other beings, Sauron crushed many of the kingdoms of the Elves, laying waste to their cities and slaughtering their
people. It was these acts that led to the war of the Last Alliance, where
Gil-galad would lead his people to march upon Sauron's forces and where he would ultimately perish. To this day, a comparative fraction of the Elves
that inhabited Middle-earth still remain, either hidden from the Dark Lord,
or protected by powers even he cannot breach.*

*The greatest of the remaining Elven halls is the haven of Rivendell. A tranquil place of peace, Rivendell is protected by power enough to keep even Sauron at bay. Elrond, an Elf lord present at the Battle of the
Last Alliance, is its master. Under his rule, all manner of Free Peoples are welcomed into the haven in good faith: the company of Thorin
Oakenshield stopped there to rest following their hounding by the wolves of Azog's hunters. Similarly, The Fellowship of the Ring was formed within its
halls before setting out upon their quest to Mount Doom to destroy the One
Ring. Rivendell often serves as the meeting place for the council of the wise
and many times have the White Council met within its walls to discuss
matters of great importance.*

*Though greatly diminished compared to the majestic Elven hosts of Ages past, the Elves can still form one of the mightiest armies within
Middle-earth. There are few, if any, who can match the martial skill of Elven warriors, let alone the skill of their lords. Masters with the use of a
bow, the marksmanship of the Elves is unrivalled across Middle-earth --
beyond count is the number of Orcs who have died skewered by an Elven arrow. The Knights of Rivendell are amongst the greatest cavalry the Free
Peoples can unleash, and from atop their mounts, they can cut through the ranks
of enemy hordes with exceptional skill.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Gil-galad, High King of the Elves;

Elrond, Master of Rivendell; Glorfindel, Lord of the West;

Erestor; Elladan & Elrohir; Arwen UndÃ³miel; Lindir of Rivendell; CÃ­rdan; Gildor Inglorion; Bilbo Baggins; High Elf Captains; High Elf Stormcallers; High Elf Warriors and Rivendell Knights.

the freedom of Middle-earth. Though Gil-galad would never see the Dark Lord finally
defeated, for he perished at the hands of Sauron upon the slopes of
Orodruin, his name lived on in songs and legends â€” even those sung by Sam during the

Should one brother be killed, the surviving brother will immediately increase their Strength by 1 and decrease their Defence by 1. The surviving brother will automatically pass all Courage tests they are forced to make and must do everything they can to Charge the model that killed their brother as quickly as possible. Once that model is killed, the surviving brother must move as fast as possible towards the closest enemy model for the remainder of the game, charging if able. Additionally, if the model that killed the brother is a Hero model, the first time the surviving brother is in combat with his brother's killer, he must declare a Heroic Challenge, targeting that Hero, without spending Might.

Able to manipulate the powers of nature, the Stormcallers, whilst not the most powerful of mystics, are able to call upon great gales and gusts of wind to buffet their foes and send them sprawling to the floor, making them an easy target for the blades of the Elven warriors.*

[]{#bookmark622 .anchor}**HALLS OF THRANDUIL**

*Deep within the gloom of Mirkwood lie the halls of the Elvenking, Thranduil. Unlike the Elven kingdoms of Rivendell and LothlÃ³rien, the Elves of Mirkwood have little interest in the world outside their borders, choosing instead to rarely set foot beyond their own realm unless they have great cause to.*

*Thranduil, the king of the Woodland Realm, is a proud and stubborn
lord, one who has faced great loss over the ages. Since the passing of his
wife, Thranduil has cared little for the rest of Middle-earth or the fate of
those that enter his realm, unless he is able to use them to obtain something he
wants. His son, Legolas, commands the Palace Guard, the most elite warriors in the ranks of the woodland realm's armies, and is one of the greatest
archers in the history of Middle-earth, a skill that he utilises many times
throughout the latter years of the Third Age. Under their young prince's command,
the Palace Guard have ever been on hand to defend the borders of Mirkwood from the foul creatures that would seek to destroy them.*

*The bulk of Thranduil's grand army is made up of the Mirkwood Elves. Clad in shining armour and armed with a variety of weapons, from their fabled bows to doubled-ended glaives, a weapon unique to the Elves of Mirkwood. The glistening hosts of Mirkwood are a formidable army upon the battlefield, and a force that have kept the woodland realm safe
from intruders for many long years.*

*Since the Necromancer took up residence within the walls of Dol
Guldur, Mirkwood has become a dangerous place to live. Those that wander off alone are rarely seen again, either because they strayed from the path
and became lost, or succumbed to a grisly fate within the forests boughs.
Packs of Wargs stalk the pathways of Mirkwood, and deep within the gloom, other fouler creatures lurk, waiting to ensnare the unwary. These creatures
have become bolder since the dark power fell upon the forest, and Greenwood
the Great is the Greenwood no longer.*

*It is the duty of the Mirkwood Rangers to patrol Thranduil's realm,
and rid the forest of any threats to the safety of his halls. Patrol
leaders, such as the fiery Tauriel, lead the Rangers in their duties, and more often
than not will take the lead in the clearing out of the Giant Spider nests
that are appearing in the forest more and more frequently.*

*As the Battle of the Five Armies approaches, the armies of Thranduil
will have to put aside their issues with the wider world and take up arms.
For they must fight for not just their own survival, but also for the very
future of Middle-earth.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm; Legolas Greenleaf, Prince of Mirkwood; Tauriel; Palace Guard Captains; Mirkwood Captains; Mirkwood Ranger Captains;

Palace Guard; Mirkwood Elves; Mirkwood Cavalry; Mirkwood Rangers and Wood Elf Sentinels.

**ARMY BONUS**

"The Elves of Mirkwood are not like their kin. They are less wise, and more dangerous" â€” Mirkwood Rangers from this force do not count towards the army's Bow Limit. Additionally, whilst they are within 3" of Thranduil, all Palace Guard Captains, Mirkwood Elf Captains, Palace Guard, Mirkwood Cavalry and Mirkwood Elves will also gain +1 to their To Wound rolls when making Strikes.

*The ruler of Mirkwood, Thranduil is a wise but proud king who cares
little for those beyond his own borders. He journeys to Erebor to
reclaim the white gems of Lasgalen that dwell within the mountain, gems that Thranduil
desires above all else in order to remember his late wife. When his
attempt to barter the Arkenstone for the return of these gems fails, Thranduil
prepares to launch an assault upon Erebor. However, the arrival of
Azog's armies cuts short the feud between Elves and Dwarves, and Thranduil prepares for a
battle he did not expect. Riding his mighty Elk into the fight, the
Elvenking's skill with a blade is unmatched in his realm, as countless Orcs would
discover at the Battle of the Five Armies.*

It is their duty to warn the realms of the Elves of any danger and to aid in the woodland's protection. The sentinels carry lutes, horns and other musical instruments on their patrols.

Enchanting Song â€” *The magical songs woven by the tunes of the
sentinels can serve*

*a variety of different uses.*

A Sentinel may sing one song each turn, provided they are not Engaged in
combat. These function exactly like Magical Powers except that they are
automatically cast without spending Will, and cannot be resisted.

The Hymn of Elbereth â€” Range 12" â€” This beautiful song raises the
spirits of the targeted model. The target friendly model will automatically pass all
Courage tests for the remainder of the turn.

Eldamar Madrigal â€” Range 12" â€” The target enemy model must
immediately take a Courage test. If the test is passed, nothing happens. If the test
is failed, the target model falls under the control of the opposing player who may then
move it up to its maximum Move, even if it has already moved that turn. This
move cannot be used to enter an enemy's Control Zone, dismount, lay down, perform an
action that would cause harm to the target (such as jumping off a cliff, etc)
or anything that would require the model to roll a D6 (such as a Jump test). Affected
models may move no further that turn.
 The Lay of Gondolin â€” This somber verse recalls the mighty Elf city of Gondolin â€” a name fit to freeze the hearts of Evil beings. If the Sentinel sings this song, they cause Terror until the end of the turn.

[]{#bookmark705 .anchor}**RADAGAST'S ALLIANCE**

*Radagast the Brown is one of the Istari as well as a member of the White Council. However, unlike his colleagues, Radagast is an unusual fellow. Rather than concerning himself with the problems of the wider world, he has instead chosen to live a life of solitude within the southern borders of Mirkwood.*

*Within his home in Rhosgobel, Radagast has developed an incredible affinity with nature, one that has provided him with many allies across Middle-earth. First of these allies is the Great Eagles of The Misty Mountains, who have even been known to allow the Brown Wizard to ride upon their back during flight â€” a great honour that is rarely bestowed upon other races in Middle-earth. Radagast's avian allies have certainly proven their worth in the latter years of the Third Age, answering the Brown Wizard's call to join the Battle of the Five*

*Armies, rescuing Gandalf from the pinnacle of Orthanc and even coming to the rescue at the Battle for the Black Gate.*

*Radagast's list of allies does not stop with the Great Eagles, however, for he has also found friends among the beasts of the world. The greatest of these is the skin-changer, Beorn, a man capable of shifting his shape from a tall and strong human to a vicious bear. A man who keeps himself to himself at his home in the Carrock, Beorn shares in Radagast's love for nature and makes sure that he protects those beings around his homestead from all manners of evil. Although largely a being of peace, Beorn is not adverse to battle when it comes to defending his lands from the Orcs that roam the wilds. Beorn also joins Radagast and the Eagles at the Battle of the Five Armies, taking great delight in righting the wrongs done to his race by the Pale Orc.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Radagast the Brown, Beorn, Gwaihir and Great Eagles.

The profile for Gwaihir can be found on page 83. Gwaihir counts as a Hero of Valour if taken as part of a Radagast's Alliance army list.

**ARMY BONUS**

"The Eagles are coming!" â€” Eagle models from this army list gain a bonus of +1 to their Strength on a turn in which they charged.

 *One of the Istari sent to Middle-earth during the Third Age, Radagast is a Wizard of great power â€” in his own way. Preferring the company of animals to that of other races, Radagast's affinity with nature is second to none. Although he often travels atop his sleigh pulled by Rhosgobel rabbits, Radagast has also been gifted with the rare privilege of riding the Great Eagles of The Misty Mountains.*

*High up in The Misty Mountains roost the Great Eagles of Middle-earth. Largely indifferent to the*

*noble and proud birds that rarely involve themselves with the goings-on of the wider world. These majestic creatures nonetheless possess an incredible intellect and a predatory fierceness seldom found in combination with each other.*

*There are few in Middle-earth that are even aware of the Great Eagles' existence, and there are fewer still who can say that they have ridden as a passenger upon one, for the Eagles of The Misty Mountains are not quick to trust those they meet. It is said that only the Wizards have earned true friendship with the Eagles, but how this friendship was first formed is a secret known only to the Istari and
the Eagles themselves.*

*Whilst remaining aloof from the conflicts of the lands below, there have been occasions in which the Eagles have intervened to*

*provide aid for those in need. It was the Eagles that came to the rescue of Frodo and Sam on the slopes of Mount Doom, a deed that undoubtedly saved the exhausted Hobbits' lives. It was the Eagles who rescued the company of Thorin Oakenshield from the baying Wargs of Azog's pack, and Gwaihir himself was responsible for the rescue of Gandalf from the pinnacle of Orthanc, allowing the Grey Wizard to escape Saruman's clutches. They have been known on rare occasions to aid the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in much larger battles. Without the arrival of the Eagles at both the Battle of the Five Armies and the Battle of the Black Gate, it is likely that countless Men, Elves and Dwarves would have been slaughtered by the vast hordes that opposed them.*

*As the Third Age draws to a close, the Eagles of The Misty Mountains must join with the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in an effort to prevent darkness from descending upon the world. For should the world become wreathed in shadow, the Eagles will likely face the same doom as the
other races of Middle-earth.*

[]{#bookmark771 .anchor}**THE WHITE COUNCIL**

*Formed in order to combat the growing power of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, the White Council contains arguably the greatest assembly of wisdom and martial prowess of this Age or any other. When called upon to fight, the White Council are all but unmatched in the ways of combat and magical power, making them a very real threat to the evil that is sat simmering within the ruins of Dol Guldur.*

*The leader of the White Council is Saruman, the greatest of the Istari
and a formidable Wizard. His power extends further than any of the other Istari sent to Middle-earth, and his knowledge of sorcery is far greater
than that possessed by any of his colleagues. As well as Saruman, two other Istari also form a part of the White Council.*

*The first of these is Gandalf the Grey, and whilst Saruman considers
him to do nothing but meddle in the affairs of the free folk, Gandalf is
intent on ensuring that evil does not again find a foothold in Middle-earth.
The final Istari within the ranks of the White Council is Radagast, the
Brown Wizard. Though thought of as useless by Saruman, it is actually
Radagast that alerts Gandalf to the growing darkness within Dol Guldur. Without the somewhat scatterbrained Wizard, it is possible that the White
Council may not have known of the danger until it was too late.*

*Aside from the Istari, the council also contains the most powerful and noble Elf lords in Middle-earth. With unrivalled skill with a blade, these mighty warriors provide the council with great martial prowess. Elrond, the Master of Rivendell, is one of the council's chief members and is both a skilled fighter as well as a talented diplomat. He accompanies his colleagues to Dol Guldur to combat the Necromancer and the NazgÃ»l head on. Glorfindel is an Elf lord with a lineage that stretches back for many years. Over his long life, he has carried out many great deeds and accomplished many heroic feats, causing his name to be steeped in legend â€” enough to strike fear into the hearts of his foes.*

*Perhaps the most compelling figure within the White Council, however,
is Lady Galadriel. An Elf of unparalleled power, Galadriel is without
doubt the greatest member of the council, and arguably the most powerful
being in all of Middle-earth. Those that are brave or foolish enough to stand
in her way will be swiftly subjected to her awesome wrath.*

*It is this group of beings that have tasked themselves with protecting
the Free Peoples of Middle-earth from harm, and those that seek to destroy the peace that many have fought so hard to preserve will be dealt a
quick and just judgment on the blades of the White Council's swords or by its immeasurable magical power.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: Saruman the White; Galadriel, Lady of Light; Elrond, Master of Rivendell; Gandalf the Grey; Radagast the Brown; Glorfindel, Lord of the West and Celeborn.

The profile for Elrond, Master of Rivendell can be found on page 62. Elrond, Master of Rivendell counts as a Hero of Valour if taken as a part of a White Council army list.

[]{#bookmark812 .anchor}**WANDERERS IN THE WILD**

*Whilst some of those that wander do so complete and with their wits intact, there are also those who have been driven mad by grief or worse. The latter was the unfortunate situation that befell the Dwarf lord, ThrÃ¡in. Driven into madness following the beheading of*

*his father at the hands of the Pale Orc, ThrÃ¡in fled into the wild before being captured and tortured at the hands of the Necromancer of Dol Guldur. Years of being subjected to torment has left ThrÃ¡in a broken Dwarf, barely able to remember his own name, let alone his proud heritage.*

**ARMY COMPOSITION**

This army may include: ThrÃ¡in the Broken.

**ADDITIONAL RULES**

The Wanderers in the Wild represent the strange and mysterious folk who do not fit into any army, and as such are not represented as an army on the Allies Matrix. Each profile in the Wanderers in the Wild will state which armies they can ally with, and what level of alliance they will be.

**ARMY BONUS**

As the Wanderers in the Wild are not an army, and not even really a fighting force, there is no Army Bonus for them.

*Captured and tortured, ThrÃ¡in is now a broken being who is barely able to remember his name, let alone his proud history and heritage. He is still dangerous, however, for deep in his damaged mind lies the instincts of a proud Dwarf warrior.*

He is Impossible Allies with all other army lists.

**SPECIAL RULES**

Shattered Spirit â€” *The torment ThrÃ¡in has endured has left his spirit
broken.*
 At the start of every Priority phase, before rolling for Priority, ThrÃ¡in must take an unmodified Courage test. If the test is passed, he acts normally. If it is passed on a double, ThrÃ¡in adds +2 to his Fight, Strength, Attacks and Courage until the end of the turn. If the Courage test is failed, then the opposing player controls ThrÃ¡in as if he was one of their models. If ThrÃ¡in is being used as a Good model, then when he fails his Courage test, the only difference between him and other Evil models is that Good models cannot target ThrÃ¡in with missile fire or Magical Powers that cause damage, and cannot make Strikes against him. ThrÃ¡in must always take this Courage test, he can never be forced to automatically pass it.

**ALLIES**
 ThrÃ¡in the Broken is an interesting character in that his profile may be used for either the Good or Evil side â€” a first for the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game.
ThrÃ¡in the Broken is Historical Allies with The White Council, so long as the army contains Gandalf the Grey; and Historical Allies with the Dark Powers of Dol Guldur, so long as it includes The Necromancer of Dol Guldur.
