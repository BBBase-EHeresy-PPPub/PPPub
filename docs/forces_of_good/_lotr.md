.anchor}INTRODUCTION]

[*F*][*rom the noble
horse lords of the kingdom of Rohan, to the foul denizens of the deep
that dwell and multiply within the depths of the black pit of Moria, the War of The Ring encompassed numerous
armies, peoples a nd factious that would fight for the freedom of Middle-earth, or to see it fall into darkness and into the
service of the Dark Lord
Sauron.*]

[*Welcome to The Armies of The Lord of the Rings, the comprehensive
guide to all of your favourite armies and factions for the forces of Good and the legions of Evil found in The Lord of the Rings
trilogy. This tome is a companion to the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, which you will need a copy of to get
the most out of this
publication.*]

[WHAT DOES THIS MANUAL
CONTAIN?]

[ARMY LISTS]

[*Within these pages you will find all of the profiles for the Heroes and Warriors from The Lord of the Rings, including their points values, characteristics, special rules and Heroic Tiers, all organised into a whopping 27 army lists! Ranging from the vast standing army of Minas Tirith, to the peaceful Hobbits of The Shire, there are army lists to represent almost every fighting force within Middle-earth. Each army list will contain all of the profiles available to that list, that army list's Army Bonus, a selection of background detailing the history and battles surrounding that particular faction, and anything else that you may need to know in order to game with your favourite armies.*]

[ALLIES MATRIX]

[*The Armies of The Lord of the Rings also includes the full Allies Matrix for both Good and Evil, containing all of the army lists from both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. The full mles for each level of alliance (Historical, Convenient and Impossible), as well as all of the details for creating allies within your games, can also be found
here.*]

[NARRATIVE PLAY
SCENARIOS]

[*Alongside all of the profiles and Allies Matrix is a selection of 11 Narrative Play Scenarios. These Scenarios feature events and battles from across the history of Middle-earth, with a particular focus on the armies and factions present at the time of the War of The Ring and those from the history of Middle-earth that directly relate to them. The broad spectrum of Narrative Play Scenarios means that almost every army list features within at least one Scenario in one way or the other, giving collectors a chance to play a Narrative Scenario with their favourite faction, or to experience new armies and tactics.*]

[WHAT ABOUT THE
HOBBIT?]

[*Fear not fans of the models from The Hobbit, all of the profiles, army lists, rules and Scenarios that focus on the characters and events from The Hobbit are presented in The Armies of The Hobbit. The Armies of The Hobbit works in much the same way as this manual, and is fully compatible with the Middle-earth Strategy Battle
Game.*]

[[]{#bookmark10 .anchor}THE
FELLOWSHIP]

[*I*][*n all the long
history of Middle-earth, there are few Heroes as celebrated and admired as The Fellowship of the
Hing.*]

[*Formed al the Council of Elrond in Rivendell, this unlikely band of nine companions set out to do the impossible - destroy the Ring of Power and free Middle-earth from
darkness.*]

[*Led by the wandering Istari Gandalf the Grey, The Fellowship contains representatives from all of the races of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. Prom the race of Men, a Ranger of the North going by the name of Strider, and the noble Boromir from the city of Minas Tirith lent their swords in defence of their people. The Dwarves were represented by Gimli son of Gldin, a steadfast and proud warrior, who pledged to see the Ring destroyed. Legolas Greenleaf, an Elf of the woodland realm, joined The Fellowship - ensuring that the Elves would finally see that the power of the Ring was ended as it should have been over 3,000 years
before.*]

[*Most importantly, however, The Fellowship would contain four Hobbits - the most unlikely of creatures to join such a quest. Frodo Baggins, accompanied by Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, set out from The Shire to deliver the Ring to Rivendell - only to be thrust into adventure beyond their wildest imaginations. Frodo would bear the Ring, as he had proven himself resilient to its powers in bringing it to
Rivendell.*]

[*The journey to Mordor was fraught with peril, although many early challenges were overcome. They escaped the clutches of the Watcher in the Water and fled the ruins of Balin's Tomb. But upon the Bridge of Khazad-dum, Gandalf was forced to confront a dreaded Balrog of Morgoth in order to cover The Fellowship's escape from Moria, an encounter that would leave The Fellowship one member short - at least for a
time.*]

[*However, it was upon Amon Hen, by the banks of the Anduin, where The Fellowship was broken. Frodo, along with his companion, Sam, set off for Mordor alone, not wishing to bring any more death upon those who pledged themselves to this quest. Determined to make right his wrong-doings towards Frodo through his failed attempt to take the Ring, Boromir fought off the Uruk-hai who came to claim the Hobbits and take them to Isengard. Ultimately however, Boromir was slain and Merry and Pippin were captured. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas were faced with a decision - to go after Frodo and forsake Merry and Pippin to torture and death; or to give chase to the Uruk- hai and allow Frodo to venture into Mordor
alone.*]

[*As the three hunters gave chase to the scouts of Isengard, Frodo edged ever closer to the Mountain of Fire, unsure of how he could go about accomplishing his task - however, it is often the smallest things in Middle-earth that can make the biggest of
differences...*]

[ARMY COMPOSITION]

[*This army may include: Frodo Baggins; Samwise Gamgee; Meriadoc Brandybuck; Peregrin Took; Gandalf the Grey; Aragorn - Strider; Legolas Greenleaf; Gimli son of Gloin; Boromir of Gondor; Bill the Pony and
Smeagol.*]

[ADDITIONAL RULES]

[*Unlike normal warbands, a Fellowship warband is comprised entirely of Hero models. Additionally, a Fellowship warband that contains Samwise Gamgee may also contain Bill the Pony. If the warband only contains Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, then it may also include
Smeagol.*]

[ARMY BONUS]

[*"You have my Sword" - As long as Frodo is alive and on the table (or escapes the board in Scenarios where this applies), all models from The Fellowship army list gain the Fearless special rule. Additionally, a force that consists solely of models from The Fellowship army list will never be considered Broken if Frodo is alive and on the table (or escapes the board in Scenarios where this
applies).*]

[![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image11.jpeg)![](../media/2_MESBG_-_Armies_of_LOTR_media/image12.jpeg)

[*After the Ring is passed to him by his uncle, Bilbo, Frodo sets out on the perilous journey to deliver it to Rivendell - only to find himself undertaking the gigantic task of taking the Ring to Mordor, and the fires of Mount Doom. Whilst certainly not a fearsome warrior, Frodo more than shows his worth, proving that the smallest creatures can indeed change the course of history.*]

[*Before setting out with The Fellowship, Sam had been a gardener and was happily content with his simple life. However, when the time has called for it, Sam has proven to be fiercely loyal to Frodo, overcoming seemingly insurmountable odds to help Ws companion in his struggle with the Ring. In fact, without Sam, it is likely that Frodo would not have Sot very far at
all...*]

years, Gandalf has become very fond of The Shire and the Hobbits who reside there, seeing them for the remarkable creatures they truly
are. After discovering the Ring in The Shire, Gandalf sets about formulating a plan to see it destroyed, and the Evil of Sauron finally
defeated.*]

[*The eldest son of the Steward of Gondor, Boromir is arguably the greatest warrior in The Fellowship. Sent to Rivendell following his father's prophetic visions, Boromir sought to use the Ring as a weapon against Sauron. Desperate to do his father's will, Boromir pleaded for the Ring to be allowed to go to Gondor. However, it was this desperation that allowed the Ring to poison Boromir's mind and drive him into madness and thus to his
doom.*]

[THE SHIRE]

[*T*][*he Hobbits
that reside within The Shire are a peaceful race, quite content to ignore, and be ignored by, the world of the big folk. In fact, to many who live in Middle-earth, Hobbits seem to be of little or no relevance at all, and are not considered as warriors or counted among the wise. Hobbits will seldom leave the boundaries of the four Farthings of The Shire, preferring to stay within the comfort of what and where they know.*]

[*On the whole, the Hobbits of The Shire live peaceful lives and enjoy the simple things life offers, such as good food, the brewing of ales and the smoking of pipe-weed. However, where a Hobbit's heart truly lies is in peace and quiet and good tilled earth, for all Hobbits share a love of things that grow - it is for those reasons that a Hobbit makes an excellent
gardener.*]

[*The Grey Wizard, Gandalf, has always found Hobbits to be remarkable creatures and he will often visit The Shire to show off his fireworks at one of the Shire's famous parties; in fact, the
display at old Bilbo's 111th birthday is still talked about decades later. However, Gandalf has come to the aid of The Shire more than once when they have been in great peril, and he has also sought out the aid of the Dunedain to keep a watchful eye upon its borders in order to keep it safe from those who mean it
harm.*]

[*However, even The Shire has been thrust into turmoil and war at times. Following his defeat at Isengard, the Wizard Saruman, going by the guise of Sharkey, invaded The Shire and enslaved its people. Upon their return, Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin rallied those with the courage to stand with them in rebellion against the invaders in the fight to reclaim their
home.*]

However, shortly after becoming a father, Arathorn was tragically slain by an Orc raiding party. Years later, following his fostering by the Elves of Rivendell, it was Arathorn's own son, Aragorn, that took up the mantle of Chieftain of the Dunedain, embarking on a quest that would see him claim his true heritage as heir to the throne of Gondor.*]

Casting down evil warlords from their footholds, driving the cruel Haradrim back to the southlands and besting the warlike fanatics that resided in the east, the armies of Ntimenor prevailed in every contest - proving that the combination of valour and Numenorean steel could win out over the black- hearted cruelty that resided within lesser
Men.*]

[*Over many years, Elendil forged strong alliances with others who resided in Middle-earth. However, the greatest alliance that Elendil forged was no doubt with Gil-galad, the High King of the Elves. Such an alliance was a truly formidable one, joining Elves and Men in friendship and combining the might of their armies. Yet, despite this alliance, peace always seemed to be but. a finger out of Elendil's reach. The Haradrim and Easterlings harboured a deep hatred for the Men of Ntimenor, which continued to grow as the years went on, and they attacked the borders of his domain ceaselessly. Bands of Orcs also managed to grow within the dark places of the world as the power of Sauron began to rise, a portent of darker times to
come...*]

[*When the time finally came for Sauron to strike against his enemies, his hammer blow fell first upon the realm of Gondor, for it lay upon his own doorstep. It was these terrible acts of war that prompted the Last Alliance of Men and Elves to march upon the strongholds of Sauron, in a bid to prevent the Dark Lord from conquering Middle-earth. Although these wars would eventually claim Elendil's life, the legacy he would leave behind endured for Ages to come, with the sister realms of Arnor and Gondor standing as proud bastions against the darkness that would attempt to poison
Middle-earth.*]

[*Arguably the greatest Man in the history of Middle-earth, it was
Elendil who led the Men of Nilmenor to Eriador following the drowning of Westernesse. A wise and noble king, Elendil was unmatched by Men in
battle. Together with his sons, Elendil led his followers in the war of the Last Alliance against Sauron, and following a gruelling
battle with the Dark Lord, was slain upon the slopes of Mount Doom... although it is without a doubt that this act delivered Middle-earth from
the hands of the Lord of the

T1RITH]

[*T*][*o the south of
Rivendell and Rohan lies the ancient and powerful realm of Gondor, the first and foremost bastion against the armies of Mordor. By the end of the Third Age, Gondor is but a shadow of her former seif, yet still a dominant force in Middle-eart h. The high kings of old no longer rule Gondor, for their line was doomed to fail. The realm's leadership has passed into the hands of the stewards - tasked with the rule of Gondor until a rightful heir
returns.*]

[*kike many realms, war is a constant companion of Gondor, for Sauron's power has risen once more and his armies assail its borders. With the former capital of Osgiliath now a crumbling ruin, power in Gondor resides within the walls o\] the White City of Minas Tirith. Built into the very bones of Mount Mindolluin and fashioned of seven levels, Minas Tirith is the greatest fortress of the race of Men. Each circle of the city is protected by walls of elegantly crafted stone, showcasing the craftmanship of the city's people. Should one circle fall, the gates to the upper levels can be closed and the defence of the city can start anew. However, such is the stoutness of the walls, that the first circle has never been
taken.*]

[*The armies of Minas Tirith are the greatest in the realm of Men at the closing of the Third Age. Each warrior is trained to fight with a variety of weapons, from the keen-edged steel sword each wears at their hip, to the use of a bow. Indeed, those who excel in the latter may well be chosen to join the ranks of the Rangers of Gondor, serving under the command of Faramir. Others are trained to ride upon fine steeds and as such form the Knights of Minas Tirith. The most skilled warriors in Minas Tirith are tasked with guarding its walls, above all else. They become Guards of the Citadel, a great honour amongst the warriors of
Gondor.*]

[*If Minas Tirith is renowned for its armies clad in gleaming plate, it is nonetheless best known for its mighty heroes, such as Boromir, who reclaimed the city of Osgiliath, or his brother, Faramir, who leads the rangers oflthilien in the protection of the realm by patrolling tirelessly along Gondor's border with Mordor. I lowever, the greatest hero of Gondor in the Third Age is undoubtedly Aragorn, Isildur's own heir, who returned to Minas Tirith to lead her armies against the might of Sauron at the height of the War of The Ring.*]

[ARMY COMPOSITION]

[*This army may include: Aragorn, King Elessar; Gandalf the White; Denethor, Steward of Gondor; Boromir, Captain of the White Tower; Faramir, Captain of Gondor; Peregrin Took, Guard of the Citadel; Beregond, Guard of the Citadel; Madril, Captain of Ithilien; Damrod, Ranger of Ithilien; Cirion, Lieutenant of Amon Barad; Knights of the White Tower; Captains of Minas Tirith; Kings of Men; Warriors of Minas Tirith; Knights of Minas Tirith; Rangers of Gondor; Citadel Guards; Guards of the Fountain Court; Osgiliath Veterans; Gondor Battlecry Trebuchets and Gondor Avenger Bolt

Tirith, bringing with him an army to turn the tide of the battle. It is following this great victory that Aragorn finally claims his birthright,
albeit reluctantly. He rallies his allies to march upon the Black Gate, providing Frodo with the much needed distraction to allow him to cross
Mordor unimpeded. The coming of King Elessar not only heralds the ending of the Dark Lord, but also a change in the fortunes of Gondor

[[]{#bookmark126 .anchor}THE
FIEFDOMS]

[*A*][*t the height
of Gondor's power, her rule stretched far across many realms of Middle-earth. From beyond Isengard to the west and to the depths of Harad in the south, people knelt to the rule of Gondor and received the prosperity that came with her protection. Although the royal bloodline no longer sits upon the throne and Gondor's influence has been significantly reduced by war, there are provinces that still swear fealty to it - these Fiefdoms will answer Gondor's call for aid should it ever be
needed.*]

[*Greatest amongst the Fiefdoms is the land of Dol Amroth, ruled over by Prince Imrahil. Although the prince holds no rule over the other realms, such is the respect held for him that many of the Fiefdom's lords will come to him seeking his counsel and advice. When the War of The Ring comes to Gondor, Imrahil leads his swan-helmed knights into battle upon the fields of the Pelennor. In fact, it is Imrahil and his Swan Knights that ride out with Gandalf in order to rescue Faramir from the Nazgul, as well as lead Gondor's counter-attack against the forces of
Mordor.*]

[*Whilst Dol Amroth may be the most notable of Gondor's Fiefdoms, they are by no means the only ones who answered her call for aid. The land of Lossarnach provides many of its finest and highly skilled axemen for Gondor's cause, led by their aptly named lord, Forlong the Fat. From Lamedon, Angbor the Fearless brings as many of his clansmen as he can muster, a brave and reckless force of formidable fighters that have become hardened by constant war in the mountains. The Rangers of the Blackroot Vale may not be as skilled in melee but their lives in the mountains of Morthond have allowed them to hone their accuracy with a bow, making them a valuable ally.*]

[*It is upon the fields of the Pelennor that these Fiefdoms will show the value of an oath sworn, fighting bravely for the freedom of all of those in Middle-earth. Each lord and warrior will win glory in life and death, both for themselves and for the Fiefdoms that they represent. Although eventually the forces of Mordor will be pushed back and the battle shall be won, many of these lords and warriors will not survive to share in Gondor's
victory.*]

It is Imrahil who rides with Gandalf, leading the forces of Gondor and ensuring that the White City does not fall. Imrahil also leads the charge out of Minas Tirith's gates, coming to the aid ofAragorn and Earner and playing his part in ensuring victory upon the
Pelennor.*]

[*The lord of Lossarnach, Forlong is one of the most famous lords in all of the Fiefdoms. Although his name makes light at his immense girth, Forlong is still a fearsome warrior in his own right, possessing an exceptional martial prowess and tactical mind. I Hs massiw size also hides an impressive strength, making Forlong easily capable of shattering the shields of his foes and reducing the warrior behind to a

DUNHARROW]

[*I*][*n a time prior
to the battles of the Last Alliance in
the*]

[*Second Age, there was a small kingdom that existed within the boundaries of the White Mountains - between Dol Amroth in the south and Calenardhon (now known as the kingdom of Rohan) in the north. Little is known about those that dwelt within this kingdom, save for the fate that befell
them.*]

[*Towards the end of the Second Age, the kingdom of Numenor sought allies in the war against the Dark Lord Sauron and the armies of Mordor. Isildur, son of the High King Elendil, came to the people of the White Mountains, as he had to many others, in search of their allegiance. There, Isildur obtained an oath-sworn promise of aid in the coming wars against the forces of Evil. However, when called upon to take up arms in the fight against Sauron, the people of the White Mountains fled, opting instead to entomb themselves within their mountain fortress instead of fulfilling the oath they had sworn to the King of Gondor.
Upon*]

[*this betrayal, Isildur cursed them to wander the hills until the time came that they fulfilled their
pledge.*]

[*Since that day, the kingdoms of Rohan and Gondor have been rife with ghostly tales of shadow-men, and it is said that the vales of Dunharrow echoed with the sounds of half-heard whispers and the faint sounds of horns and steel. These can be attributed to the remnants of the people that once dwelt in the mountain, doomed to a terrible and restless existence until Isildur's heir releases
them from their oath.*]

[*As the Third Age draws to a close, hope for these cursed Men draws near, for Aragorn, the heir of Isildur, rides to the mountain. Summoning the Dead to the stone ofErech, Aragorn commands them to fight by his side and finally fulfill the oath they made over 3,000 years before. Taking up arms, the dead march to war - a deathly force to strike fear into the armies of
Sauron.*]

[*U*][*pon his
arrival in Eriador at the end of the Second Age, Elendil founded the kingdoms of Gondor and

[*Whilst Arnor is now just a distant memory, her cities and strongholds reduced to rubble, there was a time when Amor's might was equal in measure to that of Gondor... before the kingdom was plunged into war and
despair.*]

[*In the days of her glory, Arnor achieved the same nobility that still exists in Gondor. Heroic kings who descended from the line of Numenor ruled over the lands, and the towns and villages prospered under their protection. The Evil that dwelt in the north was held at bay by Amor's vast standing armies that defended her lands and her people. It was even said that, when united as one under the banner of the king, the armies of Arnor could not be defeated; not even by the combined forces of Orcs, Trolls and Evil Men. However, fate was tempted and destiny decided to prove otherwise...*]

[*In her waning years, the Kingdom of Arnor was weakened and battered by constant war against her enemies, and was plagued by disease and famine. One by one, Amor's cities fell into min as her people fled to safer places, or were slain. Only a handful of ever- watchful rangers and guardsmen stood watch over the crumbling cities and towns that still remained. Over the years, the eastern reaches of the kingdom were left empty and more and more of the realm became abandoned, or was sacked by Evil forces. By the time of King Arvedui, only the capital, Fornost, stood proud as a bastion against Evil. That was until the final war between the realm of Arnor and the dread land ofAngmar, which saw to the complete ruin of the northernmost Kingdom of
Men.*]

[*A*][*kingdom born
out of conflict, Rohan has seen many wars since her founding in the time ofEorl the Young during the latter years of the Third Age. Having waged wars against the Dunlendings from the north, the Orcs of the White Mountains to the south and, more recently, the growing power that spreads forth from Isengard, Rohan's borders need to be constantly defended, and her sons must become warriors more swiftly than those in many other
lands.*]

[*Even in the dwindling days of the Third Age, the line of Rohan's kings can still be traced back to their greatest lord, F.orl, and each of his successors strives to be both as brave and as noble as he. At the time of the War of The Ring, the bloodline ofEorl remains in Theoden. Below the king are the Marshals of the Riddermark, steadfast and skilled warriors who each command Riders of Rohan - the pride of Rohan's armies. The horse lords are, without doubt, among the most renowned riders in Middle-earth. Their mastery as horsemen is considered without peer amongst Men, not only for their skill in the saddle, but also for their talents in breeding and raising their horses into the finest steeds in the known world - mounts that are the envy of many a
realm.*]

[*It is not surprising that the Men of Rohan prefer to fight their battles mounted atop their noble steeds rather than with their feet upon the ground. Many of the greatest heroes of Rohan have ridden to war and fought on horseback, forging their own stories of heroism and daring. Many a battle has been won by the charge of these heroes and riders, the Rohirrim smashing aside the ranks of their foes, splintering their shields and causing them to turn tail and flee.*]

[*Rohan does not have a vast standing army in the same manner as Gondor or other kingdoms. In fact, her warriors are spread out amongst the lords and marshals across her lands, each with his own Eored of riders and knights. These forces are sworn to the king, should he muster the armies of Rohan to full strength in times of war.*]

[*It is this mustering that sees Theoden raise an army of the Rohirrim to ride to the defence of Minas Tirith and to war against the armies of the Dark Lord upon the fields ofPelennor, a battle that would see the greatest charge of the Rohirrim - an act that would cement their legacy as fearless horsemen for all the ages yet to
come.*]

[***T***][***hose
that dwell in the forest of Druadan are a wild and savage race of Men. Not civilised by the standards of Rohan and Gondor, these Men have spent their lives wandering the many forest paths, memorising every route, tree and hole that resides within their
lands.***]

[*The wild race of the Men of the Druadan Forest, more commonly known as Moses, are unlike other races of Men within Middle-earth. They are thick-set and stumpy, their legs much shorter and arms much thicker than those of other Men. Donning nothing but grass skirts and coloured war paint, these Woses stalk about the boughs and branches of the Druadan Forest unseen in an effort to hunt those that intrude upon their woodland homes. Many have been the Orc warbands that have gotten lost within the thick undergrowth of the Druadan forest and tracked by its concealed inhabitants, never to be heard fiom or seen again. The Woses despise Orcs with an unrivalled hatred, and take great delight in bringing death to those that dare enter their home and wander their paths.*]

[*The weapons of the Woses are more primitive than the weapons of the Stonehouse-folk. Whilst most Men utilise steel- or iron-forged weapons, the Woses use the materials available to them in the forest. Fighting with crudely fashioned spears and daggers made from wood and stone, the warriors of the Druadan are still capable of slaying their foes thanks to stealth and speed. Alongside their spears and daggers, the Woses carry blowpipes with darts laced with a lethal poison. These weapons are almost silent and utterly deadly, able to fell multiple foes before the location of their wielder can be detected.*]

[*During the War of The Ring, the warriors of the Druadan assisted King Theoden of Rohan in crossing their forest unseen by the prying eyes of the enemy, and this is how they were able to reach Minas Tirith unopposed. Their leader, Ghdn-buri-Ghdn, offered his service to the King in order to lead the armies of Rohan safely past the Orc armies that lurked upon the edges of the forest. It is likely that if
it were not for the aid of the Woses, the Riders of Rohan would not have made it to the Pelennor in
time.*]

[***T***][***he Elves
are the oldest, wisest and most skillful of all the races in Middle-earth. They are immortal beings, many of whom have been alive since the early years of the First Age. The mighty lords who command the forces of the Elves are formidable leaders and, when the Elves unite beneath their glittering banners, there are few who can stand against their
might.***]

[*Throughout the early years of the Second Age, the Elves inhabited much of western Middle-earth. There within their great cities they prospered, free of the shadow ofMorgoth. But their prosperity would dwindle. For it was the Elven smith Celebrimbor who forged the great rings of power, teaching Sauron his craft. This was an act that would doom the lands of Middle-earth to fall before Sauron's rage, for he tricked the Elven smith and in secret forged The One Ring, cementing himself as the Dark Lord. Using his dominion over other beings, Sauron crushed many of the kingdoms of the Elves, laying waste to their cities and slaughtering their people. It was these acts that led to the War of the Last Alliance, where Gil-galad would lead his people to march upon Sauron's forces and where he would ultimately perish. To this day, a comparative fraction of the Elves that inhabited Middle-earth still remain, either hidden from the Dark Lord, or protected by powers even he cannot
breach.*]

[*The greatest of the remaining Elven halls is the haven of Rivendell. A tranquil place of peace, Rivendell is protected by power enough to keep even Sauron at bay. Elrond, an Elf lord present at the Battle of the Last Alliance, is its master. Under his rule, all manner of Free Peoples are welcomed into the haven in good faith: the company of Thorin Oakenshield stopped there to rest following their hounding by the wolves ofAzog's hunters. Similarly, The Fellowship of the Ring was formed within its halls before setting out upon their quest to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Rivendell often serves as the meeting place for the Council of the Wise and many times have the White Council met within its walls to discuss matters of great importance.*]

[*Though greatly diminished compared to the majestic Elven hosts of ages past, the Elves can still form one of the mightiest armies within Middle-earth. There are few, if any, who can match the martial skill of Elven warriors, let alone the skill of their lords. Masters with the use of a bow, the marksmanship of the Elves is unrivalled across Middle-earth - beyond count is the number of Orcs who have died skewered by an Elven arrow. The Knights of Rivendell are amongst the greatest cavalry the Free Peoples can unleash, and from atop their mounts, they can cut through the ranks of enemy hordes with exceptional
skill.*]

[*Should one brother be killed, the surviving brother will immediately increase their Strength by 1 and decrease their Defence by 1. The surviving brother will automatically pass all Courage tests they are forced to make and must do everything they can to Charge the model that killed their brother as quickly as possible. Once that model is killed, the surviving brother must move as fast as possible towards the closest enemy model for the remainder of the game, charging if able. Additionally, if the model that killed the brother is a Hero model, the first time the surviving brother is in combat with his brother's killer, he must declare a Heroic Challenge, targeting that Hero, without spending Might. This may be done even if the Hero is of a lower Heroic Tier than the surviving brother.*]

[***H***][***ome of
the race of Silvan Elves, the great woodland realm of Lothldrien has long resisted the taint of
evil.***]

[***Lying on the western banks of the Anduin, Lothlorien spans the spaces between the golden Mallorn trees and can trace its history back to the very earliest of times. Unlike the twisted forests of Mirkwood, the boughs of Lothlorien provide a sanctuary of peace and healing, a place where only the closest allies of the Elves are
welcomed.***]

[*Within the heart of Lothlorien lies the great tree-city of Caras Galadhon, home to Galadriel, the Lady of Light and the lord Celeborn. Galadriel is a mighty sorceress, an Elf of immense and terrifying power. There are few in Middle-earth who would dare to stand against her. She is the keeper of Nenya, one of the three Elven rings of power and has ever opposed the machinations of the Dark Lord.*]

[*Wise and noble, Celeborn has provided Lady Galadriel with vital counsel in the years since the Last Alliance. Together, the lord and lady of Lothlorien are mighty adversaries to the Dark Lord's designs upon Middle-earth - perhaps the only ones he truly
fears.*]

[*However, Lothlorien cannot be kept safe by the magics of Galadriel alone. It is through the martial prowess of the Galadhrim that the woodland realm has been kept free of Orcs and other foul creatures. Equal to the skills of their kin in Rivendell and Mirkwood, the Elves of Lothlorien have protected their borders for hundreds of years, keeping their glades and forests free from the corrupting influence of Sauron. Many of the Galadhrim clad themselves in golden armour, in honour of the Mallorn, before entering into battle, their plate gleaming in the sun that filters through the lush leaf canopy and radiates a brilliant light. Others prefer to don no armour at all, making them much more nimble than their armoured counterparts and allowing them to sneak up on enemy forces and slay them without so much as a sound. The greatest warriors within the armies ofLdrien are the Guard of the Galadhrim Court, a band of elite warriors whose deeds are the stuff of legend. Tasked with the defence of Caras Galadhon, the great tree-city shall not fall so long as she is defended by her
guard.*]

[*As the sun begins to set on the Third Age, the Elves prepare to stand alongside the Free Peoples in the defence of Middle-earth, now as they have always
done.*]

[FANGORN]

[***A***][***l the
close of the Third Age, much of Middle-earth is controlled by a handful of great kingdoms. There are, however, many other powers within Middle-earth, lurking within the forests and vales and avoiding the wars and conflicts of other realms.***]

[*Of these ancient lands, Pangorn is by far the oldest. Within the boughs of this great forest dwell the Ents, the tree-shepherds of Middle-earth. The Ents often resemble the very trees they live amongst, a fact that has often led them to be confused with the trees themselves. The Ents have lived in Middle-earth since the dawn of the world and once walked among the trees of all the great forests. However, in the dwindling years of the Third Age, they are few in number and reside only within
Pangorn.*]

[*The Ents give little thought to the world beyond their boundaries, not bothering themselves with the affairs of the other races in Middle-earth and they grow sleepy with the weight of millennia. The forest itself has become unruly, the Ents themselves being too few in number now to manage all of the trees under
their*]

[*protection and so some become wild and lash out at those that wander Pangorn's many paths. There have been no new Entings for a terribly long time, ever since the Entwives were lost some many centuries ago. In fact, the Entwives were lost so long ago that the Ents cannot even remember what they looked
like.*]

[*Initially refusing to join in the cause for good during the War of The Ring, the treachery of Saruman eventually ran too deep for the Ents to ignore. Huge swathes of the forest had been ripped up to fuel the forges of Isengard, with Saruman's army caring neither for the great history of those that dwell in the forest, nor the livelihood of those that still dwelt there. This heinous act was enough to spur the Ents into action, and drove them to fury. Rousing the slumbering tree-shepherds from their sleep, Treebeard, greatest of the Ents, leads the Onodrim from the depths of Fangorn Forest and together they head towards battle against the forces of Isengard. In search of vengeance for those he had known since nut and acorn, Treebeard and the Ents march to what could potentially be their doom, in an attempt to release the River Isen and wash away the filth of Saruman
forever.*]

[*There are few in Middle-earth that are even aware of the Great Eagles' existence, and there are fewer still who can say that they have ridden as a passenger upon one, for the Eagles of The Misty Mountains are not quick to trust those they meet.

themselves.*]

[*Whilst remaining aloof from the conflicts of the lands below, there have been occasions in which the Eagles have intervened

It was the Eagles who rescued the company of Thorin Oakenshield from the baying Wargs ofAzog's pack, and Gwaihir himself was responsible for the rescue of Gandalf from the pinnacle ofOrthanc, allowing the Grey Wizard to escape Saruman's clutches. They have been known on rare occasions to aid the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in much larger battles. Without the arrival of the Eagles at both the Battle of the Five Armies and the Battle of the Black Gate, it is likely that countless Men, Elves and Dwarves would have been slaughtered by the vast hordes that opposed

KHAZAD-DUM]

[*I*][*n **the early
years of Middle-earth, Durin, the father of the Dwarves, carved a home for his people from the rock of The Misty Mountains. This was to become Khazad-dtlm, the greatest of the Dwarf holds in all of Middle-earth, and it boasted the Dwarves' greatest treasure hoard. The veins of the mountains flowed with Mithril, the precious metal used to forge great weapons, armour and other items of immense value, which cemented the hold's power and influence
further.***]

[*As the years went by, time was not kind to the sons of Durin. The Dwarves delved deep into the roots of the earth, carving out cities and tunnels from the bones of the mountains. Evil was drawn to these dark places, always seeking to plant a foothold in Middle-earth. All manner of foul creatures sought to claim the mountains for their own - hordes of Goblins and Trolls swarmed the mighty hold, making the kingdom of Khazad-dum into a place embroiled in war.*]

[*However, the Dwarves of The Misty Mountains were not so easily defeated, for the Dwarves are a hardy race of stalwart and fierce fighters. Every Dwarf is trained in the art of war, forming themselves into kinbands to train those who lack experience. It is within these kinbands that grizzled veterans and battle-scarred warriors train sons, cousins and other family members in

battles.*]

[*Commanding the armies of Khazad-dum were the Dwarven kings of old, great warriors and noble lords that led the Dwarves through many years of prosperity. At the peak of Khazad-dum's glory, the kingdom was ruled by Durin, the greatest Dwarf warrior of his time and one who was worthy of being named after the father of the Dwarves. Under his rule, the great wealth of the Dwarves swelled as they dug ever deeper into the heart of the mountains. However, with such constant expansion of their kingdom, the Dwarves awoke something in the darkness, a beast of terrible power, a monster of shadow and
flame.*]

[*This was to be the undoing of the kingdom of Khazad-dum, for the Dwarves had awoken a Balrog ofMorgoth, a demon of the ancient world. It was this creature that proved to be the downfall of the Dwarves, sweeping aside their armies and slaying the mighty king Durin. Although the kingdom had fallen, its legacy is one that would be remembered throughout the ages - yet it would forever be known by a different name... the black pit of
Moria.*]

and there is little to go against these claims. Durin wore a Mithril fashioned crown and bore a great Dwarven two-handed axe. It was said
that upon the battlefield, Durin could split an enemy's shield in two with a single strike. Yet such glories could not last, for the
awakening of a Balrog was to be Durin's end. Ever since, the beast

It is this relentless training that has made the Dwarves into a race of elite warriors, every bit as tough as the armour that protects them.*]

[*Those that form the Khazad Guard are handpicked from the toughest warriors. Setting aside ties to their kinband, these warriors take new oaths to serve and protect their king, no matter the cost. In combat these battle-hardened veterans wear terrifying war-masks and don coats of Mithril armour, making the Khazad Guard the most fearsome warriors available to a Dwarven army.*]

[*The Iron Guard are a group of elite warriors, grim of face and stout of heart. Traditionally, the role of these warriors was to guard the trade routes between the varying kingdoms of the Dwarves, protecting those that travelled between them. Because of this, it has become a requirement that the Iron Guard adopt a more aggressive nature than their kin. Many Goblin raids have been halted by these warriors, with thrown axes and sword thrusts felling their
foes.*]

[[]{#bookmark320 .anchor}WANDERERS IN THE
WILD]

[***T***][***here are
those beings in Middle-earth that play no part in kingdoms or in armies and do not participate in the wars of others. Some of these beings are quite content to live out their lives settled in peaceful homesteads, whilst others wander the many paths and realms of Middle-earth either for enjoyment or out of their sense of
adventure.***]

[*On the borders of The Shire lies the Old Forest, and deep within it lies the humble home of Tom Bombadil and his wife Goldberry. Though he may be unassuming, Tom Bombadil's power is greater than even the most mighty of beings - even the One Ring had no effect upon old Tom, who seems entirely unphased by its power. Although he commands a tremendous authority over the trees of the forest, as if with some mystical and ageless power, Tom is a carefree being who will often be found in his big blue coat and great yellow boots wandering around his homestead and the surrounding forest collecting water lilies for his beloved, and singing a variety of merry tunes.*]

[*Those of good heart who stumble upon the house of Tom and Goldberry are given the warmest of welcomes, for Tom is a kindly and jolly fellow who will gladly open his doors to travellers who have strayed off the paths of the forests. It is such hospitality that was extended to Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin when they ventured through the Old Forest, and if it wasn't for old Tom it is likely that the Hobbits would never have reached
Bree.*]

[*Whilst Tom and Goldberry remain very much within the borders of the Old Forest, others roam far and wide in search of adventure and glory. There are none that embody this more than the Dwarven companions Miirin & Drdr. Whilst not blood relatives, the two Dwarves are inseparable companions, their travels having forged a bond between them 'as close as any brothers'. Across the years, Miirin & Drdr have wandered many lands and aided those in need against the forces of Evil. Their most notable exploits, however, are undoubtedly the aid they provided to Cirion during his campaign in the east - one that forged a tight alliance between Man and
Dwarf.*]

time bickering, as most Dwarves do, these close companions have travelled far and wide beyond their mountain home, and more than once
found themselves embroiled in a fight in the aid of the Free Peoples that need it most. The rash and daring Miirin has developed
great skill with his sword Kalazal, and Sauron's minions of all kinds have felt its cutting blade. In contrast Drdr is a calm and collected
fellow, preferring instead to arm himself with a bow - a weapon he possesses incredible skill
with.*]
