## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Tom Bombadil; Goldberry; Miirin & Drar; Thráin the Broken.

## ADDITIONAL RULES

The Wanderers in the Wild represent the strange and mysterious folk who do not fit into any army, and as such are not represented as an army on the Allies Matrix. Each profile in the Wanderers in the Wild will state which armies they can ally with, and what level of alliance they will be.

## ARMY BONUS

As the Wanderers in the Wild are not an army, and not even really a fighting force, there is no Army Bonus for them.

No models may move into Tom's Control Zone for any reason, unless his controlling player allows it. Models that are Hurled, Barged or forced towards Tom in any other way will stop 1" away from him and he will suffer no effects. Tom may Charge enemy models as normal and his side will automatically win any Fight that Tom is involved in, however neither Tom nor any model in the same Fight may make Strikes of any kind. Tom and all friendly models within 3" of him will automatically pass Courage tests. Tom may never carry objectives in Scenarios that require objectives to be picked up.

- **Hey! Come Merry Dol! (PASSIVE)**

Tom Bombadil must give up a point of Will at the end of each turn in which he participated in a Fight during the Fight phase. Should Tom Bombadil be reduced to 0 Will, or there are no other friendly models other than himself and Goldberry, then he will simply wander back off to his homestead. Remove the model as a casualty.

### THRÁIN THE BROKEN [10 POINTS]

**SPECIAL RULES**

- **Shattered Spirit (PASSIVE)**

At the start of every Priority phase, before rolling for Priority, Thráin must take an unmodified Courage test. If the test is passed, he acts normally. If it is passed on a double, Thráin adds +2 to his Fight, Strength, Attacks and Courage until the end of the turn. If the Courage test is failed, then the opposing player controls Thráin as if he was one of their models. If Thráin is being used as a Good model, then when he fails his Courage test, the only difference between him and other Evil models is that Good models cannot target Thráin with missile fire or Magical Powers that cause damage, and cannot make Strikes against him. Thráin must always take this Courage test, he can never be forced to automatically pass it.

**ALLIES**

Thráin the Broken is an interesting character in that his profile may be used for either the Good or Evil side — a first for the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game.

Thráin the Broken is Historical Allies with The White Council, so long as the army contains Gandalf the Grey; and Historical Allies with the Dark Powers of Dol Guldur, so long as it includes The Necromancer of Dol Guldur.

He is Impossible Allies with all other army lists.
