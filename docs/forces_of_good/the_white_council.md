# THE WHITE COUNCIL

Formed in order to combat the growing power of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, the White Council contains arguably the greatest assembly of wisdom and martial prowess of this Age or any other. When called upon to fight, the White Council are all but unmatched in the ways of combat and magical power, making them a very real threat to the evil that is sat simmering within the ruins of Dol Guldur.

The leader of the White Council is Saruman, the greatest of the Istari and a formidable Wizard. His power extends further than any of the other Istari sent to Middle-earth, and his knowledge of sorcery is far greater than that possessed by any of his colleagues. As well as Saruman, two other Istari also form a part of the White Council.

The first of these is Gandalf the Grey, and whilst Saruman considers him to do nothing but meddle in the affairs of the free folk, Gandalf is intent on ensuring that evil does not again find a foothold in Middle-earth. The final Istari within the ranks of the White Council is Radagast, the Brown Wizard. Though thought of as useless by Saruman, it is actually Radagast that alerts Gandalf to the growing darkness within Dol Guldur. Without the somewhat scatterbrained Wizard, it is possible that the White Council may not have known of the danger until it was too late.

Aside from the Istari, the council also contains the most powerful and noble Elf lords in Middle-earth. With unrivalled skill with a blade, these mighty warriors provide the council with great martial prowess. Elrond, the Master of Rivendell, is one of the council's chief members and is both a skilled fighter as well as a talented diplomat. He accompanies his colleagues to Dol Guldur to combat the Necromancer and the Nazgûl head on. Glorfindel is an Elf lord with a lineage that stretches back for many years. Over his long life, he has carried out many great deeds and accomplished many heroic feats, causing his name to be steeped in legend — enough to strike fear into the hearts of his foes.

Perhaps the most compelling figure within the White Council, however, is Lady Galadriel. An Elf of unparalleled power, Galadriel is without doubt the greatest member of the council, and arguably the most powerful being in all of Middle-earth. Those that are brave or foolish enough to stand in her way will be swiftly subjected to her awesome wrath.

It is this group of beings that have tasked themselves with protecting the Free Peoples of Middle-earth from harm, and those that seek to destroy the peace that many have fought so hard to preserve will be dealt a quick and just judgment on the blades of the White Council's swords or by its immeasurable magical power.
