# THORIN'S COMPANY

Thorin Oakenshield's search for his father led him to a chance encounter with the Grey Wizard. In the Prancing Pony, Gandalf set Thorin upon a path for redemption, to march upon Erebor and retake his homeland. Thorin sets off to attempt to rally the seven Dwarf armies to his cause, while Gandalf heads to The Shire in search of a burglar.

This search led Gandalf to Bag End, only to be greeted by Bilbo Baggins as if he were selling buttons at the door. The reluctant Hobbit was soon subjected to the Dwarves descending upon his quiet home. Although he was unaware of it at the time, Bilbo would join these Dwarves in their quest to reclaim The Lonely Mountain and form the Company of Thorin Oakenshield.

Alongside Thorin stood his nephews, Kíli and Fíli. Young and brash by Dwarven standards, these brothers had much to learn about the workings of the world. Balin, and his brother Dwalin, had fought alongside Thorin since the glory days of Erebor. They were present for the coming of Smaug and the loss of Erebor, and fought at the battle of Azanulbizar against the armies of the Pale Orc.

Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur all joined the company from their home in the Blue Mountains. A jolly and light-hearted Dwarf, Bofur served the company well by raising the spirits of those around him, and formed a close bond with Bilbo. Bifur, on the other hand, was unable to speak the common tongue at all. This was entirely due to the jagged axe-blade that jutted from his skull. Bombur was easily the largest of the Dwarves — and it was he who all but emptied Bilbo's pantry upon the Dwarves' arrival at Bag End.

The brothers Ori, Nori, and Dori, who hailed from the Blue Mountains, also joined Thorin's Company. Dori was the oldest of the three and would spend most of his time trying to keep his two brothers out of trouble, for Nori was a renowned troublemaker and pickpocket, while Ori was the youngest of the company. Óin and Glóin were the final members of the company, both unable to resist the lure of potential treasure.

It was this legendary band of unlikely heroes that would journey through Goblin tunnels, spider-infested forests, and a town atop a lake as they set out to reclaim Erebor.

## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Thorin Oakenshield; Balin the Dwarf; Dwalin the Dwarf; Kíli the Dwarf; Fíli the Dwarf; Bifur the Dwarf; Bofur the Dwarf; Bombur the Dwarf; Ori the Dwarf; Nori the Dwarf; Dori the Dwarf; Óin the Dwarf; Glóin the Dwarf; Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey.

### THORIN OAKENSHIELD [100 POINTS]

**DWARF, INFANTRY, HERO — HERO OF LEGEND**

Thorin Oakenshield is the heir to the throne of Erebor, a Dwarf of noble heritage and great courage. In the long years following the Dwarves' exile from their homeland, Thorin led his people well, forging a new home for them in the Blue Mountains. However, a chance meeting with Gandalf the Grey has set Thorin upon a path to take back Erebor and reclaim his home. This task will take every ounce of the Dwarf prince's skill, strength, and courage to accomplish, as well as no small amount of help from his kin and one unsuspecting burglar!
