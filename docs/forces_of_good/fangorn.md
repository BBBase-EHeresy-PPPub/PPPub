## ARMY COMPOSITION

This army may include: Treebeard and Ents.

## ARMY BONUS

**"Don't be Hasty!"** - Ent models from this army list gain the Fearless special rule. Additionally, Ent models are completely unaffected by any Magical Powers or special rules that would prevent them from moving or move them against their will (the only exception is that they will still take the hit from a Sorcerous Blast, but will suffer no further effects). Additionally, Ent models are completely unaffected by the Nature's Wrath and Wrath of Bruinen Magical Powers.

**OPTIONS**

- Merry & Pippin: 10 points

- **Merry & Pippin (PASSIVE)**

If this option is taken, both Merry & Pippin will ride into battle upon Treebeard. They will use their profiles from the Fellowship army list (see page 10), but will count as being from the Fangorn army list for all intents and purposes. Although this will not give Treebeard the Cavalry keyword, Merry & Pippin count as Passengers upon Treebeard with the exception that enemy shooting or attacks may not target them. Whilst upon Treebeard, Merry & Pippin may still use their [Throw Stones] special rule, using their own Strength and range, even if Treebeard has moved this turn, without suffering the -1 penalty for moving and shooting. Should they dismount, Merry & Pippin may re-mount Treebeard by moving into base contact with him.

**SPECIAL RULES**

- [Terror]
- [Throw Stones] (range 18", Strength 10)
- [Woodland Creature]
- **Bludgeon (BRUTAL POWER ATTACK)**

Select one enemy model in the Fight to be picked up by the Ent and become the bludgeon. If the model is a Cavalry model, the rider is picked up and immediately dismounted. This model cannot be a Monster.

Select another model in the Fight for the Ent to hit with the bludgeon. Both the target and the bludgeon suffer one Strength 8 hit. If the target is slain, the Ent may pick another target and repeat the process again. This may be done repeatedly until either the Ent fails to slay a target, or there are no more eligible targets to choose. Should the bludgeon survive, they will be knocked Prone. Note that the Ent may keep using the bludgeon even if the bludgeon is slain.
