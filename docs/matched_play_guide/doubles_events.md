[***"I can't carry it for you, butI can carry
you.***]

[***Come on!"***]
 [***- Samwise Gamgee, TheLord of the Rings: The Return of the King***]

[D][oubles events have always been a
popular way to play the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game; there is just
something about teaming up with a friend to do battle against another team that most
hobbyists get a real kick out of. Being able to team up and use your collective gaming experience and knowledge to play a game, and
no doubt have a friendly rivalry along the way about
whose]

[part of the army can kill the most, are just some of the reasons that
Doubles games will often stick in the minds of those who play them for many years.]

[Over the next few pages, we are going to present some additional rules
for playing Doubles events, as well as six brand new Scenarios specially written for Doubles games for Tournament Organisers to use at
their events. Each Scenario is balanced in the same way as the standard Matched Play Scenarios so that they can be used in
Doubles tournaments, and will provide a new fun twist on playing Doubles games.]

[When running a Doubles event, it will follow the same format as a
standard tournament with the exception that the event will use the Doubles Scenarios presented over the next few pages rather than the
Scenario Pool system.]

[THE ARMY]

[A Doubles army will always comprise two forces, each controlled by a different player. Each force must be built to the same points limit, so that each force has half of the overall points. The two forces may not share leftover points with their
partner.]

[*For example: Jay and Rob are playing as a team, each with a 400 point force. Although Jay only spends 395 of his points, he may not give his
spare 5 points to Rob and so Rob can still only spend 400 points as
well.*]

[A force must be from a single Army List, and so may not contain any models from a different Army List. However, one force may be from a different Army List to the
other.]

[Bow Limit is calculated for each force individually, not across the whole army.]

[The rules for Allies will still apply in Doubles events, so if the two forces are from the same Army List, or are Historical Allies, then they will keep their respective Army
Bonuses.]

[At the beginning of each game, before rolling for deployment zones, both players in a team roll-off (re-rolling any ties) with the force belonging to the player that scored highest becoming the Primary Force, and the other becoming the Secondary
Force.]

[LEGENDARY LEGIONS]

[If players wish then they may elect to play using a Legendary Legion. In this situation both players must bring a separate force from the same Legendary Legion, following all the usual restrictions. If, however, a Legendary Legion requires certain Hero models to be taken as part of the force, then only one player will be able to bring that Hero (there is only one of them after all!). Restrictions for a Legendary Legion are applied across the whole army; however, each force must contain its own separate warbands.]

[*For example: Jay and Rob have decided to use the Return of the King Legendary Legion. Jay chooses to have Aragorn in his list, whilst Rob takes the King of the Dead. This way, as a team they have fulfilled the criteria for the Legendary Legion (having to take Aragorn and the King
of the Dead) even though each individual force may
not.*]

[If a Legendary Legion states that a specific Hero is always the army leader, then whichever force the model is in will automatically be the Primary Force for each game — there is no need to roll.]

[THE LEADER]

[The leader of the Primary Force is considered to be the leader of the entire army for the duration of that
game.]

[BREAKING]

[For Doubles games, the Break Point is worked out across the entire army rather than each individual
force.]

[SCENARIO 1 — NO ESCAPE]

[*Half of each army is fighting at the centre of the battlefield, with
the rest of their enemies bearing down upon
them.*]

[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[Kill as much of the enemy force as possible whilst protecting your own in the centre of the battlefield.]

[THE ARMIES]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both teams roll a D6 — the team that scores highest becomes Team A and chooses one of the deployment zones in the centre of the board. Team A then deploys their Primary Force within 6" of the centreline of the board in their deployment zone. Team B then deploys their Primary Force within 6" of the centreline of the board in their deployment zone. Team A then deploys their Secondary Force within 6" of the board edge in the opposite half of the board to their Primary Force; Team B then does the
same.]

[ ]

[OBJECTIVES]

[The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models or below, at which point the team that has
scored]

[the most Victory Points wins the game. If both teams have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a
draw.]

[SCORING VICTORY POINTS]

[You score 1 Victory Point for causing one or more Wounds on the enemy leader (Wounds prevented by a successful Fate roll do not count). If you kill the enemy leader, you instead score 3 Victory Points.You score 3 Victory Points if the enemy force is Broken
at the end of the game. If the enemy force is Broken, and your force is unbroken, you instead score 5 Victory Points.You score 1 Victory Point
if you have at least one banner remaining at the end of the game. If you have at least one banner, and your opponent has none remaining, then you instead score 2 Victory Points.You score 2 Victory Points if you kill
the leader of the Secondary Force.]

[INITIAL PRIORITY]

[Both teams roll a D6. The team with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.]

[![](../media/matched_play_guide/image41.jpeg)

[SCENARIO 2 — TOTAL CONQUEST]

[*Two enemy forces are embroiled in a deadlock on the battlefield. Only
by their allies joining the fight and taking control of key areas can
they achieve victory.*]

[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[There are five Objective markers on the board. Control the most to achieve victory]

[THE ARMIES]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. One Objective marker is deployed in the centre of the board. The other four Objective markers are placed halfway in-between the centre of the board and each corner as shown on the map.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both teams roll a D6 — the team that scores highest becomes Team A and chooses one of the deployment zones in the centre of the board. Team A then deploys their Primary Force within 6" of the centre of the board in their deployment zone. Team B then deploys their Primary Force within 6" of the centre of the board in their deployment zone. Both Secondary Forces are kept aside for later in the game.]

[INITIAL PRIORITY]

[Both teams roll a D6. The team with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.]

[OBJECTIVES]

[The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models or below, at which point the team that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both teams have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.]

[Maelstrom of Battle: At the end of your Move phase, roll a D6 for each of your warbands not on the battlefield and consult the chart below (the warband's captain can use Might to alter the roll either up or down). Models can't charge in the turn that they arrive but otherwise act normally. Roll for each warband separately, deploy the models in the warband, then roll for the next. Warbands yet to arrive count as being on the battlefield for the purposes of determining if your force is
Broken.]

[*The two rival forces are converging upon a site of great power;
whomever controls it will secure
victory.*]

[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[Control the central objective to claim
victory.]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. A single Objective marker is placed in the centre of the board.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both teams roll a D6 — the team that scores highest becomes Team A and chooses a corner. The chosen corner and the one opposite are Team A's deployment zones; the other two corners are Team B's deployment zones. Team A then deploys their Primary Force within 12" of their chosen corner. Team B then deploys their Primary Force within 12" of one of their corners. Team A then deploys their Secondary Force within 12" of their other corner. Finally, Team B deploys their Secondary Force within 12" of their other corner.]

[INITIAL PRIORITY]

[Both teams roll a D6. The team with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.]

their enemies; whoever slays the most shall earn a great
victory.*]

[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[Have both forces' leaders kill more than the two enemy
leaders.]

[THE ARMIES]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both teams roll a D6 — the team that scores highest becomes Team A and chooses a board edge. Team A then deploys their Primary Force within 24" of their board edge. Models may not be deployed further than 6" from the captain of their warband. When this has been done, Team B deploys their Primary Force within 24" of their board edge. Teams then take it turn to deploy their Secondary Forces following the same
restrictions.]

[INITIAL PRIORITY]

[Both teams roll a D6. The team with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.]

[OBJECTIVES]

[The game lasts until the end of a turn in which one force has been reduced to a quarter (25%) of its starting number of models or below, at which point the team that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both teams have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.]

[SCORING VICTORY POINTS]

-   
 [Keep a count of how many kills the leaders of both forces score in combat throughout the course of the battle. Note, kills caused by shooting, Magical Powers or the Hurl Brutal Power Attack do not count towards your leader's score.You score 3 Victory Points if your leaders have killed more models than your opponent's leaders. If your leaders have killed at least two models and at least twice as many as your opponent's leaders, then you instead score 5 Victory Points. If your leaders have killed at least three models and at least three times as many as your opponent's leaders, then you instead score 7 Victory Points.]

-   
-   

[You score 2 Victory Points for each enemy leader that has been killed in combat by one of your team's leaders.You score 1 Victory
Point if the enemy army is Broken at the end of the game.SPECIAL RULES]

[Friendly Rivalry: Whilst the two allies' leaders are fighting alongside each, they are still both trying to prove that they are the better fighter of the two.]

[Keep a record of how many kills the leaders of both forces have killed in combat individually. For each army, whichever of the two leaders has the least kills out of the two in combat gains a bonus of +1 To Wound during a Fight. This bonus ends immediately as soon as they have drawn equal to or overtaken their
ally.]

[SCENARIO 5 — CORNERED]

[*With one force surrounded, their allies must fight to save them from
the combined might of their enemies.*]

[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[The defenders must seek to protect the central force, whilst the attackers seek to destroy
them.]

[THE ARMIES]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[LAYOUT]

[Set up terrain as described on page 136 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual. There should be a terrain piece in the centre of the board, no more than 6" in diameter, for the team that ends up in the middle to
defend.]

[STARTING POSITIONS]

[Both teams roll a D6 — the team that scores highest becomes Team A. Team A then deploys their Primary Force within 6" of the centre of the board. Team B then deploys their entire army at between 6" and 12" away from Team A's deployment area. Team A then sets up their Secondary Force anywhere within 3" of any board edge.]

[INITIAL PRIORITY]

[Both teams roll a D6. The team with the highest score has Priority in the first turn.]

[OBJECTIVES]

[Once one army has been Broken, the game might suddenly end. At the end of each turn after this condition has been met, roll a D6. On a 1-2, the game ends — otherwise, the battle continues for another turn.]

WITS]

[*Each force has been tasked with eliminating key enemy targets, though
in the heat of battle they have been unable to relay this information to their allies.*]

[SCENARIO OUTLINE]

[Each force secretly selects an enemy Hero. Try to kill the Heroes chosen by your team, whilst simultaneously getting your selected Heroes into the centre of the board.]

[THE ARMIES]

[Players choose their forces, as described on page 130 of the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game rules manual, to an equal points value before the game.]

[Both teams roll a D6 — the team that scores highest becomes Team A. Team A then chooses two opposite quarters of the board, and then deploys their Primary Force within one of their chosen quarters but not within 12" of the centre of the board. Team B then deploys their Primary Force within one of the two remaining quarters, but not within 12" of the centre of the board. Team A then deploys their Secondary Force within their other quarter, but not within 12" of the centre of the board. Finally, Team B deploys their Secondary Force within the last remaining quarter, but not within 12" of the centre of the board.]

[At the end of the game, the team that has scored the most Victory Points wins the game. If both teams have the same number of Victory Points, the game is a draw.]

[SCORING VICTORY POINTS]

[At the start of the game, each player secretly writes down one enemy Hero model to be the target of their forces. This means that each team will have two targets. Players may not discuss with their partner which Hero they have chosen for the duration of the game — it is secret from all players accept the player who wrote it down.]
