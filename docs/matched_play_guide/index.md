Welcome to the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game Matched Play Guide; your way to get the very best from your Matched Play experiences, whether they be at tournaments and gaming weekends or at your local gaming club.

The Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game has always lent itself well to a Matched Play environment, and players have been organising their own tournaments around the globe for years. This supplement is designed to help players run their own Matched Play events by providing them with a system to organise their tournaments with, balanced Scenarios and ways to choose them, and a selection of alternative special rules that Event Organisers can use in order to add that extra bit of flair to their events should they wish.
