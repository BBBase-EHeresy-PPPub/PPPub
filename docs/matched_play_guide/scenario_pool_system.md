At the start of each round of a tournament, you will need to decide which of the 18 Scenarios everyone will be playing.

Whilst the Tournament Organiser can decide to simply choose which Scenario is played, or randomly draw any of the Scenarios out of a hat, we would recommend using the following Scenario Pool system to choose the Scenario.

The 18 Scenarios are grouped into six pools of three Scenarios, where each pool will contain Scenarios with a similar style of gameplay; this may be focusing on killing the enemy army, controlling the battlefield, etc.

At the start of each round, the Tournament Organiser will roll for which of the pools will be in use for that game. They will then roll for which of the three Scenarios from that pool will be played. Once a pool has been selected for a round, it cannot be selected again unless all other pools have already been selected once (in events that have more than six games for example), in which case the process begins again making sure that the same Scenario is not played twice.

Whilst this system is essentially about randomly choosing Scenarios from the 18 available, it ensures that players will only ever play one Scenario from each pool across the event, and prevents the Scenarios that are randomly determined favouring one style of army over another. 

*For example: In the first round of an event, Pool 4 is rolled. Then the Organiser rolls a D3 to determine which of the three Scenarios from that pool will be played. After rolling, it is determined that Lords of Battle is the Scenario for round 1, and this means that players will now not play either To the Death! or Contest of Champions as Pool 4 has already been selected during this event.*

Additionally, each pool will always have one, and only one, Scenario that has the random game length stipulation. This means that you may not play any of these Scenarios across an event, or you might play six!

What this system tries to do is ensure that there is always a balanced spread of Scenarios across a tournament, so that a tournament isn't simply won by the fact that the Scenarios simply favoured one style of army or force. This will help to provide all players with a better all-round
experience.

There are other ways that Organisers can use the Scenario Pool system if they wish:

* They may select only two pools and players will play all of the Scenarios from those pools in a random order.
* They may select three pools, and play two Scenarios from each pool.
* They may simply select one Scenario from each pool and then randomise the order in which those Scenarios are played.

The Scenario Pool system is designed to enhance your tournament experience, and provide new and exciting challenges for your list building.

## THE POOLS

At the start of each round, roll a D6 to determine which of the pools will be used, then a D3 to determine which of the three Scenarios from that pool will be played. After this has been decided, remove the entire pool from the selection process.
