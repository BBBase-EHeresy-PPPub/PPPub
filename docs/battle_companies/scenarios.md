Once you have gathered your force and found yourself an opponent, it is time to decide which of the Battle Company Scenarios you should play. You can either agree with your opponent which of the 18 Scenarios you would like to play, or you can randomise by rolling on the charts below. First, roll a D6 to determine which of the three tables to roll on next. Then roll a second D6 to determine which Scenario you will play. It is usually a good idea for one player to roll the first dice then the other player roll the second — that way which Scenario you play is equally both players' fault!

All Battle Companies Scenarios are played on a 48"x48" board and can be played on pretty much any terrain that you wish. With games of Battle Companies comprising very few models, it is often a good idea to have your boards covered in very dense amount of terrain to really add that extra level of depth to your games. Some Scenarios may have specific terrain requirements; where this is the case, it will be clearly listed in the Scenario itself.

There are even rules for fighting in certain areas of Middle-earth, which can be found on **page 84**.
