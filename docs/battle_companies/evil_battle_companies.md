- 2x Corsair of Umbar with spear
- 2x Corsair of Umbar with bow

**ADVANCEMENTS**

- Corsair of Umbar with bow – Corsair Arbalester

**ARMY SPECIFIC HERO UPGRADE**

**'Shadows of Umbar'** – The corrupt and shadowy streets of Umbar have taught the Hero how to conceal themselves to the untrained eye, making their sudden attacks all the more deadly. If the Hero is partially concealed from view, they cannot be seen at all at distances more than 6" – they appear to melt into the background. This means that enemies cannot Charge or shoot the Hero, nor target them with Magical Powers or special rules at distances greater than 6", unless they have a completely clear view of the Hero.

**UNIQUE WARGEAR**

Smoke Bombs (1/5) – 2 Influence Points – These are a throwing weapon with a Strength of 1. Any model hit, but not slain, by these weapons must immediately expend a point of Will or be subjected to the effects of the Transfix Magical Power. Should this model ever roll a 1 To Hit with their Smoke Bombs, then their supply has run out and they cannot use them for the remainder of the game.
