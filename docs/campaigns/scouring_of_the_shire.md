## SCOURING OF THE SHIRE
CAMPAIGN** 

Here we present you with the Scouring
of the Shire campaign, a system that links the Narrative Play Scenarios in this volume together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later on! This will make the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the movies. 

As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the skirmishes and events that happened within the Shire from when Sharkey began to take over to the return of the Travellers. The Scenarios start with the amassing of the Ruffians in Bree, and the very beginning of Sharkey's regime under the influence of his puppet, Lotho Sackville-Baggins, through to the various arrests of well-meaning Hobbits and the birth of a small rebellion, to the final Battle of Bywater - the most famous battle in the history of the Shire. 

You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though if you wish, different players can take control of different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order, as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one
plays... 

**SCENARIO BONUSES** 

After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in the Maggot's Farm Scenario, the Good side will receive a bonus in the Battle of Bywater Scenario - a much later Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the future. 

  

**THE LOCKHOLES** 

As an added feature to make this campaign really mirror the cruel regime that Sharkey has imposed across the Shire, you may choose to use this optional rule for your campaign. Should any Hobbit Hero model be captured or removed as a casualty, it is safe to assume that they have been dragged off to the Lockholes following the battle should the Evil side win (with the exceptions of Holfoot Bracegirdle and Robin Smallburrow, who are instead bullied into following the orders of the Ruffians). Make a note of which Hobbit Hero models have been sent to the Lockholes across the campaign. Any that have been captured may not appear in any future Scenario unless they have escaped. This does not apply to any of the Scenarios that happen after the Lockholes
Scenario. 

In The Lockholes Scenario, replace the Hobbit Militia that have been arrested with any Hobbit Hero models that have been captured - this is your one chance to rescue any Hobbits that have been taken prisoner! Any Hobbit Hero models rescued in this way may then join in the Battle of Bywater Scenario. For each additional Hobbit Hero the Good player receives, the Evil player may add three additional Ruffians to their
force.
