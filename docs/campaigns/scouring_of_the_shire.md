## SCOURING OF THE SHIRE CAMPAIGN

*Here we present you with the Scouring of the Shire campaign, a system that links the Narrative Play Scenarios in this volume together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later on! This will make the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the movies.*

As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the skirmishes and events that happened within the Shire from when Sharkey began to take over to the return of the Travellers. The Scenarios start with the amassing of the Ruffians in Bree, and the very beginning of Sharkey's regime under the influence of his puppet, Lotho Sackville-Baggins, through to the various arrests of well-meaning Hobbits and the birth of a small rebellion, to the final Battle of Bywater - the most famous battle in the history of the Shire.

You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though if you wish, different players can take control of different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order, as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one plays...

**SCENARIO BONUSES**

After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in the Maggot's Farm Scenario, the Good side will receive a bonus in the Battle of Bywater Scenario - a much later Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the future.

**THE LOCKHOLES**

As an added feature to make this campaign really mirror the cruel regime that Sharkey has imposed across the Shire, you may choose to use this optional rule for your campaign. Should any Hobbit Hero model be captured or removed as a casualty, it is safe to assume that they have been dragged off to the Lockholes following the battle should the Evil side win (with the exceptions of Holfoot Bracegirdle and Robin Smallburrow, who are instead bullied into following the orders of the Ruffians). Make a note of which Hobbit Hero models have been sent to the Lockholes across the campaign. Any that have been captured may not appear in any future Scenario unless they have escaped. This does not apply to any of the Scenarios that happen after the Lockholes Scenario.

In The Lockholes Scenario, replace the Hobbit Militia that have been arrested with any Hobbit Hero models that have been captured - this is your one chance to rescue any Hobbits that have been taken prisoner! Any Hobbit Hero models rescued in this way may then join in the Battle of Bywater Scenario. For each additional Hobbit Hero the Good player receives, the Evil player may add three additional Ruffians to their force.

### TRAPS 

Some Scenarios or characters allow for the Hobbit player to deploy a selection of Traps on the board to help them gain an advantage over those that seek to bring ruin to the Shire. The special rules of either the Scenario or character will state how many of each type of Trap the Hobbit player may deploy at the start of the game. Traps are deployed after both sides have set up but before the first turn begins. Friendly models treat Traps as open ground but no model may finish their movement with their base overlapping a Trap marker.

Traps can be deployed anywhere on the board, although they must be deployed using the following rules:

- Traps may not be deployed within the enemy player's deployment zone.
- Traps may not be deployed within 3" of another Trap.
- Traps may not be deployed within an enemy model's Control Zone.
- Traps may not be deployed within 2" of an Objective marker in Scenarios where this applies.

**TRIGGERING TRAPS**

When Trap markers are deployed, they are always placed face-down so that the opposing player cannot tell what kind of Trap each Trap marker represents. When an enemy model moves within 1" of a Trap marker, they immediately stop moving – flip the Trap marker over and resolve the effects of the Trap that is revealed, as explained opposite. Models that reveal a Trap marker cannot continue moving after revealing the Trap; they have either fallen into the Trap or used the rest of their movement to avoid it.

* **TRIPWIRE TRAP**

When a Tripwire Trap is revealed, the Hobbit player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the Trap suffers a Strength 2 hit and is placed Prone. Cavalry models that reveal a Tripwire Trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also count as being Knocked Flying in addition to suffering a Strength 2 hit. Monster models are unaffected by a Tripwire Trap, and can continue to move even after revealing the Trap. After the effects are resolved, remove the Trap from play.

* **SNARE TRAP**

When a Snare Trap is revealed, the Hobbit player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the Trap is immediately knocked Prone and suffers a Strength 1 hit (they actually either have their legs tied up or are kept dangling in the air, but this has the same effect). A model that is caught in a Snare Trap cannot move until they have freed themselves. They will not stand up if they win a fight and will always count as being Trapped. During the End phase of each turn, roll a D6 for a model caught in a Snare Trap. If the result is equal to or less than the model's Strength characteristic then the model has freed themselves and may immediately stand up.

Cavalry models that reveal a Snare Trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also count as being Knocked Flying in addition to suffering a Strength 1 hit. Monster models are unaffected by a Snare Trap, and can continue to move even after revealing the Trap. After the effects are resolved, remove the Trap from play.

* **PITFALL TRAP**

When a Pitfall Trap is revealed, the Hobbit player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the Trap immediately falls into the hole. A model that falls into a Pitfall Trap may attempt to get out of the hole at the start of each of its Move phases. Roll a D6. On a 4+, the model clambers out of the hole at the cost of half of its Move value.

Whilst in a Pitfall Trap, a model always counts as being Trapped. Cavalry models that reveal a Pitfall Trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also count as being Knocked Flying in addition to falling into the hole. Monster models are unaffected by a Pitfall Trap, and can continue to move even after revealing the Trap. After the effects are resolved, leave the Pitfall Trap face-up. A model can attempt to cross a Pitfall Trap by passing a Jump test, but if they fail, they will fall into the hole. If a model is forced into base contact with the Pitfall Trap (such as when they Back Away) then they will fall into the hole. Only one model at a time can be in a Pitfall Trap.

* **DUMMY TRAP**

When an Infantry model reveals a Dummy Trap, remove the Trap from play (there is no Trap there after all!), though the model will still stop moving. Cavalry and War Beast models are unaffected by a Dummy Trap, and can continue to move even after revealing the Trap.
