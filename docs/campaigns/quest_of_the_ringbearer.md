## THE JOURNEY OF THE
RINGBEARER 

Here we present
you with the Journey of the Ringbearer campaign, a system of linking
your games together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later
on! This will connect together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are
playing through the scenes directly from the books and the
movies. 

As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the journey
that Frodo Baggins embarked on with the Ring. The Scenarios start with Frodo's journey to get the Ring to Rivendell; beginning in
the Shire and following Frodo's travels to Crickhollow, through the Old Forest and Bree, before his terrifying encounter with the Nazgûl at
Weathertop and subsequent arrival at Rivendell. From there the campaign specifically follows the path of the Ringbearer; from Moria, to
Amon Hen and then when Frodo and Sam separate from the Fellowship and go to Mordor alone. The Scenarios allow you to play
through all aspects of Frodo's quest to destroy the
Ring. 

You can play this campaign with as few as two people or, if you wish,
different players can take control of the forces in different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However,
it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one
plays... 

SURVIVING THE
JOURNEY 

LINKING YOUR GAMES 

Here we present rules on how to join your games together as you follow the journey to destroy the Ring. There are rules for what happens when members of the Fellowship are slain in battle, bonuses between Scenarios, and even how your Heroes regain their strength between games and recover their spent Might, Will and Fate points - if they aren't too weary of
course. 

There is a very real likelihood that some members of the Fellowship or their allies will perish along the journey; such dangerous adventures are not without risk, after
all. 

It is important to record when Hero models spend Might, Will and Fate or suffer any Wounds as they will have the chance to regain them after the game. Whenever a Good Hero model is slain or removed as a casualty during a game, they may not actually be dead. Instead, you will need to roll on the Campaign Injury table below for them to see what effects their injuries have. Models slain may use any remaining Might to alter the result on the table. 

D6 Result]

1.  

[Dead - This Hero has been slain in battle. If Frodo is ever slain then the campaign comes to an end and Middle- earth falls into darkness.2-3 Wounded - This Hero regains 1 Wound,
but otherwise may not regain any other characteristics unless they are chosen as the Bravest
Companion. 

4+ Recovered - This Hero regains 1 Wound and then may recover as normal. 

Additionally, if the Good player wins the Scenario then all their Hero models will gain a bonus of +1 to their rolls on the Campaign Injury
table. 

RECOVERING STRENGTH 

As our Heroes battle their way through Middle-earth they will become weary and tired beyond measure; their adventures taking their toll upon each member of the Fellowship, and often they will leave a battle exhausted and injured. To represent this, Good Hero models do not automatically regain any spent Might, Will, Fate or Wounds between games. Instead, they will regain a number of Might, Will, Fate and Wounds depending on how they performed in the previous
game. 

To do this, follow the steps on this page, starting with the Bravest Companion, then Fellow Adventurer and finally Fool of a
Took! 

Bravest Companion - After the game, both players should discuss which of the Good Hero models has performed above and beyond the call of duty. Perhaps they fended off many enemies, or sacrificed themselves for the good of the Ringbearer. This model may regain D6 Might, Will, Fate or Wounds of the controlling player's choice (this may be a mix of any) up to the value of the model's characteristics. If the Hero survived the previous battle, they may re-roll the D6 if they choose but the second result will stand even if it is worse than the first. It is important for both players to be honest when making the decision of which model is awarded the Bravest Companion as it makes for the campaign to be much more
interesting. 

Fellow Adventurer - All other Hero models may regain D3 Might, Will, Fate or Wounds of the controlling player's choice (this may be a mix of any) up to the value of the model's characteristics. If the Hero survived the previous battle, they may re-roll the D3 if they choose but the second result will stand even if it is worse than the first. The only exception to this is if a model is chosen
as... 

Fool of a Took! - After the game, both players should discuss which of the Good Hero models, if any, has performed poorly in the previous game. This model gains no bonus whatsoever. This doesn't have to be awarded if both players agree that all the Good Hero models pulled their weight fairly. It is important for both players to be honest when making the decision as to which model is awarded the Fool of a Took! as it makes for the campaign to be much more
interesting. 

REST POINTS 

At certain points in the campaign Frodo and his companions will have the chance to rest. When this is the case following a Scenario, all surviving Good Hero models will replenish their Might, Will, Fate and Wounds up to their starting values before the next game. These rest points will be clearly listed in the order of Scenarios and Scenario
bonuses. 

SCENARIO BONUSES 

After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won that Scenario, either Good or
Evil. 





**"Nine Companions. So be
it.** 

**You shall be, the Fellowship of the
Ring."** 

**-- Elrond, The Lo\^d of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring** 

INTRODUCTION 

One of the great
things about the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game is that it allows you to explore what could have happened in various different situations. This is exactly what 'Fantasy Fellowship' is all about, allowing you to create your own Fellowship of the Ring and play out the various Scenarios throughout the War of the Ring to see if your own Fellowship could save
Middle-earth. 

There are loads of 'what if' Scenarios that you could explore to change up your Fellowship before they embark on their long and arduous quest to Mount Doom. For instance, imagine if Denethor had sent Faramir to Rivendell instead of Boromir,
or 

You can even explore what would have happened if Bilbo had taken the Ring himself. Perhaps he would have been accompanied by one of the Dwarves of Thorin's Company, or maybe Heroes such as Bard the Bowman, Radagast the Brown, or even Beorn may have joined Bilbo in his quest to destroy The One
Ring. 

This is the major concept behind Fantasy Fellowship. It allows you, the gamer, to form your own Fellowship using the rules presented here and see how far along the quest to Mount Doom they can get. You can also take the original Fellowship and see if they can survive longer than in the
story. 

if Saruman had never been corrupted by the Palantír and aided the Ringbearer in his quest. What if Rohan had been present at the Council of Elrond and it was Éomer or even Théodred that journeyed instead of Boromir and
Aragorn. 



SELECTING YOUR
FELLOWSHIP 

STEP 1: THE
RINGBEARER 

Naturally, your Fellowship must have a Ringbearer to carry the Ring to Mount Doom. This can be any one of the four following profiles:]

-   
-   
-   
-   

[Frodo Baggins (from The Fellowship army list)Bilbo Baggins (from the
Thorin's Company army list)Bilbo Baggins (from The Shire army
list)Sméagol (from The Fellowship army list)If your chosen Ringbearer is
Sméagol then he gains The Ring. Additionally, he ignores his 'Serve the Master of the Precious' special
rule. 

STEP 2: COMPANION 

The second most important member of your Fellowship, every Ringbearer will need a loyal friend to aid them on their journey. This is the character that will keep your Ringbearer on track, regardless of whatever hardships and perils lie in front of
them. 

Your Ringbearer's Companion can be any Hobbit Hero that has not already been chosen as your Ringbearer, with the exception of the four Travellers: Frodo of the Nine Fingers; Samwise the Brave; Meriadoc, Captain of the Shire, and Peregrin, Captain of the
Shire. 

If Bilbo Baggins from the Thorin's Company army list is chosen then his Companion may instead be any other member of Thorin's Company under 60 points if you
wish. 



STEP 3: THE REST OF YOUR
FELLOWSHIP 

With your Ringbearer and Companion now selected, it is time to choose the remaining members of your Fellowship to join them in their journey. Each chosen member will have to replace a certain character from the original Fellowship, and will replace that character in all the Scenarios that would have featured them along the way - so decide which of your chosen members replaces which original members
wisely! 

Merry and Pippin may be replaced by any named Hero models in the game, however, neither may cost more than 50 points each, including any wargear purchased for
them. 

Gandalf the Grey must be replaced by a Hero model from the following list, all of which can utilise a variety of different Magical Powers to their advantage: Gandalf the Grey; Saruman the White; Radagast the Brown; Galadriel; Elrond, Master of
Rivendell; 

Celeborn; Círdan; Arwen Undómiel; Gildor Inglorion; Thranduil, King of the Woodland
Realm. 

If Saruman the White is selected as your Wizard then you may select Gríma Wormtongue as a member of your
Fellowship. 



SCENARIOS 

Here we present
the Scenarios that should be played as part of a Fantasy Fellowship campaign, along with the Heroes that would normally play that Scenario for you to replace with members of your own Fellowship, and where you can find that Scenario. If you wish, you can add more Scenarios to this list if you want to play through every single aspect of the
story. 

For example, if you have chosen Éomer as part of your Fantasy Fellowship, then in the Éomer's Return Scenario he will be replaced by a Captain of Rohan with appropriate wargear. Similarly, if you have selected Faramir as part of your Fantasy Fellowship then in the Osgiliath Scenario he will be replaced by a Captain of Minas Tirith with appropriate
wargear. 



\* RIVENDELL - REST

represent them in that
Scenario.

CAMPAIGN BONUSES 

During your
Fellowship's journey to Mordor, they will gain benefits along the way. These could be new pieces of wargear or improved characteristics. The full list of these campaign bonuses, who gains them, and when they will get them is listed below. 

THE WHITE WIZARD 

Following The Bridge of Khazad-dûm Scenario, Gandalf the Grey falls into the depths of Moria and no longer participates in the campaign. However, Gandalf is reborn as Gandalf the White for the Éomer's Return Scenario, and will be restored to his starting values of Might, Will, Fate and
Wounds. 

If you replaced Gandalf then whoever represents him in your Fellowship will fall at The Bridge of Khazad-dûm and come back for Éomer's Return in the same manner. To represent them coming back more powerful, your member of the Fellowship will improve all their Casting values by 1 (to a maximum of 2+) and may increase their Attacks characteristic by 1 (to a maximum of 2). 

If you replaced Gandalf with Galadriel then instead of following the rules above, she will be replaced by the Galadriel, Lady of Light profile. 

BOROMIR 

Boromir is slain at the hands of Lurtz at Amon Hen. Following this Scenario, whoever you chose to represent Boromir will also be slain at this point and will take no further part in the
campaign. 

RIVENDELL 

Upon reaching Elrond's household, Frodo is reunited with Bilbo who gifts him both Sting and the Mithril
Coat. 

Your Ringbearer gains both Sting and the Mithril Coat, unless your chosen Ringbearer is Sméagol. If Sméagol is your Ringbearer then he will instead gain an additional point of Might and
Fate. 

LOTHLÓRIEN 

When the Fellowship reaches the woodland realm of Lothlórien, they are presented with a series of gifts by the Galadhrim. All surviving members of your Fellowship (except Gandalf) are given Elven Cloaks. Additionally, each member is given a specific gift depending on the character they are representing as listed
here: 

Frodo - Light of Eärendil ^ACTIVE^ - Each turn Frodo may use a single 'free' Will point to attempt to cast the Blinding Light Magical Power. This is cast on a 3+ and cannot be Channelled. Frodo cannot use this if he is wearing the
Ring. 

Sam - Elven Rope ^ACTIVE^ - The bearer always counts as rolling a 6 for any Climb, Jump or Leap tests that he has to
make. 

Merry & Pippin - Daggers of the Noldorin ^ACTIVE^ - The bearer may re-roll any failed To Wound rolls in
combat. 

Aragorn - Elven Dagger ^ACTIVE^ - This is an Elven-made dagger with the Uruk-haibane special
rule. 

Legolas - Bow of the Galadhrim ^ACTIVE^ - Whilst within 3" of a friendly model, the bearer may re-roll any failed To Hit rolls when shooting. 

Gimli - Galadriel's Locks ^ACTIVE^ - Gimli may re-roll all dice in a Duel roll. Gimli may only use this ability three times per
game. 

Boromir - Golden Belt ^ACTIVE^ - The bearer gains the Woodland Creature special
rule. 

HELM'S DEEP 

For The Battle of Helm's Deep Scenario, the Three Hunters don armour to help protect them against the Uruk-hai. The Hero models representing Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli all gain armour if they don't already have some form of
armour. 

MERRY AND PIPPIN 

For the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Hobbits wear armour when they go to war. From Scenario 18 onwards, the Hero models representing Merry and Pippin gain armour for all Scenarios if they don't already wear some form of
armour. 

CIRITH UNGOL 

By the time he has awoken in Cirith Ungol, Frodo no longer has Sting or the Mithril Coat. From the Tower of Cirith Ungol Scenario onwards, Frodo no longer wears the Mithril Coat or carries the Phial of Galadriel. Additionally, Sam now bears
Sting. 

THE BLACK GATE 

Before setting out for the Black Gate, Aragorn dons the armour and robes of the King of Gondor. If you are using Aragorn then he is replaced by the Aragorn, King Elessar profile. Alternatively, the Hero replacing Aragorn gains Andúril for the 'End of All Things' Scenario.

ROSTER

you with a roster for your Fantasy Fellowship. This includes space for
you to write down each of your members, what wargear they have, and their current Might, Will, Fate and
Wounds.]
