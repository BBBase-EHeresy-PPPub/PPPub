## THE JOURNEY OF THE RINGBEARER CAMPAIGN

*Here we present you with the Journey of the Ringbearer campaign, a system of linking your games together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later on! This will connect together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the movies.*

As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the journey that Frodo Baggins embarked on with the Ring. The Scenarios start with Frodo's journey to get the Ring to Rivendell; beginning in the Shire and following Frodo's travels to Crickhollow, through the Old Forest and Bree, before his terrifying encounter with the Nazgûl at Weathertop and subsequent arrival at Rivendell. From there the campaign specifically follows the path of the Ringbearer; from Moria, to Amon Hen and then when Frodo and Sam separate from the Fellowship and go to Mordor alone. The Scenarios allow you to play through all aspects of Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring.

You can play this campaign with as few as two people or, if you wish, different players can take control of the forces in different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one plays...

### SCENARIO BONUSES

After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won that Scenario, either Good or Evil. Depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in the next Scenario. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in a future Scenario.
