## RISE OF ANGMAR CAMPAIGN

*Here we present you with the Rise of Angmar campaign, a system for linking your games together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later on! This will join together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the stories of Middle-earth.*

As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the battles and events that happened during the founding of Angmar and the Witch-king's subsequent rise to power, at the expense of the waning kingdom of Arnor. The scenarios start some years following the splintering of Arnor into three smaller realms - Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur - and will begin with the forces of Angmar growing and conquering Rhudaur. From there you will be able to play through many of the well-known (and some lesser-known) events during the fall of Arnor; from the ruin of Amon Sul, to Arvedui's last defence of his kingdom, through to the epic Battle of Fornost that heralded the defeat of Angmar. There are also some Scenarios that focus on what happened in the years following the Witch-king's defeat at Fornost, as well as further Scenarios in the appendix that follow the lineage of Isildur at the close of the Third Age.

You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though, if you wish, different players can take control of different Scenarios - that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order, as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one plays.

**SCENARIO BONUSES**

After each Scenario has been completed, it is necessary to note down which side won that Scenario, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in the Assault on Rivendell Scenario, then the Good side will receive a bonus in the An Unlikely Ally Scenario - a much later Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the future.
