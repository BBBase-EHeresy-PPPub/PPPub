CAMPAIGN 

O][ver the following
pages, we present you with the Fall of the Necromancer campaign, a system of linking your games together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later on! This will join together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the
movies. 

As you may have already read, this supplement focuses on the battles and events that happened following Sauron's return to Middle-earth and the secrecy surrounding his stronghold of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood. The Scenarios start with Sauron founding the fortress of Dol Guldur upon Amon Lanc in the year 1000 of the Third Age. From there you will be able to play through many of the well-known (and some lesser-known) events following the Dark Lord's return; from the corruption of the Greenwood to Gandalf's first exploration of Dol Guldur in which the Necromancer flees to ensure his return remains secret, beginning the time known as the Watchful Peace. There are then more Scenarios that depict some of the events shown, or mentioned, in The Hobbit™: Motion Picture Trilogy, such as Legolas and Tauriel clearing the spider nests, the attack on Radagast's home of Rhosgobel, all the way up to the final battle where Sauron reveals his return to the White
Council. 

You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though if you wish different players can take control of different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one
plays... 

SCENARIO BONUSES 

After each Scenario has been completed, note down which side won that Scenario, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Evil side is victorious in the Flight to the East Scenario, then the Evil side will receive a bonus in the Capture of the Grey Wizard Scenario - a much later Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the
future.
