DEFENCE OF THE NORTH CAMPAIGN 

Here we present you with the Defence
of the North campaign, a system for linking your games together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later on! This will join together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the movies. 

As you may have already read, this supplement focuses on the battles and events that happened in the northern region of Rhovanion at the time of the War of the Ring. The Easterlings have marched upon the kingdoms of Erebor and Dale, and Sauron has sent hordes of Orcs to assault the Elven realms within Mirkwood and Lothlórien. This campaign is slightly unusual in that it is essentially three shorter campaigns in one. Sauron's plan was to have the Easterlings defeat the forces of Dáin and Brand whilst a host of Orcs conquered Mirkwood. Then the two armies would converge on Lothlórien, joining the army already there, to combine forces and defeat the Galadhrim. 

The Defence of the North campaign mirrors this as it starts with the war of the Easterlings against Erebor and Dale, then moves on to the battles in Mirkwood, before finishing with the skirmishes within Lothlórien. Though these battles all happen at roughly the same time, we have decided to separate them out into the three shorter campaigns so that they can be played out individually. Also, the victor in each of these regions will gain bonuses for the battles happening elsewhere. 

You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though, if you wish, different players can take control of different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one
plays... 

Another way that you can play this campaign, rather than to play it as one long series of battles, is to play each of the
shorter campaigns individually and see which side can win the most; perhaps even having different players doing different parts of the campaign. If the Evil side wins the Battle of Dale, and then the Good side wins the Defence of Mirkwood, then it will be all to play for in the Assault on Lothlórien! 

Whichever side wins the final battle in a campaign will be the overall winner of that campaign. 

SCENARIO BONUSES 

After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won that Scenario, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in The Hosts Clash Scenario, then the Good side will receive a bonus in the Plains of Erebor Scenario - the next Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the future.
