[WAR IN ROHAN CAMPAIGN 

Here we present you with the War in
Rohan campaign, a system of linking your games together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later on! This will join together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the movies. 

As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the battles and events that happened within the kingdom of Rohan, from the treachery of Saruman and the burning of the Westfold, all the way to the Siege of Helm's Deep. The Scenarios start with Saruman siding with the Dark Lord and forging an army of Orcs, Uruk-hai and Wild Men; the Dunlending's attack on Rohan's villages and the burning of the Westfold, through the battles at the Fords of Isen and the troubles that surround Rohan, before reaching the epic battle at the fortress of Helm's Deep - one of the most iconic battles to take place during the War of The Ring. 

You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though if you wish different players can take control of different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one
plays. 

  

SCENARIO BONUSES 

After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won that Scenario, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in the Grishnákh's End Scenario then the Good side will receive a bonus in the Last March of the Ents Scenario - a much later Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the
future.
