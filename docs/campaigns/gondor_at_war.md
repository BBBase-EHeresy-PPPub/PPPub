*Here we present you with the Gondor at War campaign, a system for linking your games together in such a way that the results of one game can impact the next, or even one much later on! This will join together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the movies.*

As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the battles surrounding the realm of Gondor during the time of the War of the Ring. They range from Osgiliath being captured by Orcs and then retaken by Boromir, through to the Battle of Pelennor Fields, before finally reaching its conclusion at the Black Gate, where you can choose to either play that final battle how it is shown in the films, or how it is portrayed in the novels - the choice is yours! 

You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though if you wish, different players can take control of different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order, as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one
plays. 

**SCENARIO BONUSES** 

After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was the victor, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in The Battle for Pelargir Scenario, it will have an impact on the Docks of Harlond - a much later Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the
future.

Following The Dead Arrive Scenario, the campaign progresses to The Black Gate. You may have noticed that we provide players with two different ways to play this Scenario, either following the movies or the books. When you get to this stage, simply decide among the players which of these versions you would like to play. Once you have played one version, why not give the other one a try – both are great fun and have their own series of challenges!
