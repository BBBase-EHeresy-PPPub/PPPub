CITADEL OR FORGE WORLD MODELS","text":"<p>This may seem obvious, but you will need some Citadel or Forge World models in order to play. Whether this is a specific collection to faithfully recreate a scene from the films, or just a selection of your favourite models arranged into an army of your own making, the choice is up to you. As you play your first few games, you'll probably find yourself using unpainted models, but as almost every hobbyist will agree, playing a game with fully painted armies both looks and feels better!</p>"},{"location":"#2-dice-and-tape-measures","title":"2. DICE AND TAPE MEASURES","text":"<p>We use tape measures or measuring sticks to see how far our models can move across the battlefield each turn, whether they are in bow range and for many other distance-related reasons. To this end, it is important to have a measuring device on hand that measures in inches. The Battle of Pelennor Fields boxed game contains a handy ruler, or you can pick up a tape measure from any Games Workshop store.</p> <p>Dice are required to see if our models are successful in their in-game endeavours, to see whether an arrow hits its target, who wins in a fight and all manner of other things. As such, you will need a selection of six-sided dice at your disposal (between eight and twelve, preferably in a few different colours, is about right).</p> <p>REFRESHMENTS</p> <p>In the finest tradition of Hobbits everywhere, it's often a good idea to have a selection of sensible snacks, such as biscuits and seed cakes, available for you and your opponent, as well as having something nice to drink (Jay will rarely go through a whole game without a nice hot mug of tea in his hand!).</p>"},{"location":"#3-playing-area","title":"3.

These stories are often focused around a small group of unlikely heroes embarking on seemingly impossible quests and adventures as they strive to overcome the evil that stands in front of them. Thorin's Company numbered just 15 when they set out from Bag End to try to reclaim their homeland of Erebor from the clutches of Smaug; and the Fellowship of the Ring consisted of only nine heroes from across the races of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, yet were able to endure great hardship and overthrow the Dark Lord Sauron.</p> <p>It is this sense of taking a small group of heroes and having them embark on fantastical journeys of daring and adventure that this supplement allows you to accomplish.

Battle Companies is designed so that players can use their imagination to tell a story, and this may, and often does, result in a few changes to the core rules of Battle Companies \u2014 and this makes for some really fun, unique and personal campaigns, which at its heart is what Battle Companies is all about!</p> <p>Often, all players in a campaign will implement a selection of additional rules for use in their games, and this is perfectly fine \u2014 in fact it is often encouraged! After all, Battle Companies is about playing a series of narrative and thematic Scenarios that further a particular storyline, and so adding in a series of extra rules that helps to accomplish this can only be a good thing.</p> <p>So, over the next few pages, we will present you with a selection of additional rules that you can use in your games. Some are good for using in almost any situation, whilst others provide rules for slightly more unusual situations that the players in a campaign may want to use for a one off Scenario. There is no pressure to use these rules if you don't fancy doing so, and you are more than welcome to make up your own if you wish.

To do this, you can spend any amount of Influence Points to place a bounty on a Hero \u2014 let your campaign organiser know so that they can keep track of the bounty. Any player can add to the bounty at any time by doing the same \u2014 the bigger the bounty on a Hero, the more likely that other companies will focus their energy on killing them. If at any point a player successfully kills the targeted Hero (note that this means killing them outright, not just having them removed from the battlefield in a game), then they may collect the bounty from the campaign organiser and add it to their Influence pool.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/additional_rules/#holding-a-hero-to-ransom","title":"HOLDING A HERO TO RANSOM","text":"<p>Losing a Hero in Battle Companies is always a troublesome thing; the hole they can leave in your company's roster is often hard to fill. After a particularly difficult game, you may find that one of your Hero models has been lost in battle; captured by the enemy forces following the skirmish that has just ensued. Normally, the rules would call for the player who lost their Hero in battle to play the Secure the Area Scenario as their next game with their lost Hero as the objective \u2014 if they win they rescue the Hero, if not the Hero will perish.</p> <p>However, you can always play an alternative if you wish in that the other company has captured your Hero and is now holding them to ransom, and will relinquish them if their demands are met. The demands could be set as a standard ransom value before the campaign starts, paying between 3-5 Influence Points to your opponent is around a fair price, or you could set your own demands when the situation arises. This could be anything from a set amount of Influence Points, a piece of wargear available to the other company that your company could not normally get, or even a cup of tea or a cake \u2014 whatever you feel would best suit the situation and provide the best narrative!</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/additional_rules/#leaders-courage","title":"LEADER'S COURAGE","text":"<p>A Battle Company can often end up having multiple Heroes, which means that when the company Breaks during a game they will all have to take their Courage tests individually, as Hero models cannot normally benefit from the Stand Fast! of other Hero models.</p> <p>One additional rule you can use is allowing the Sergeants of your Battle Company to benefit from the Stand Fast! of your leader, meaning that your leader can keep your force fighting as one.

However, they must take on at least four other Battle Companies at the same time. These other companies have put aside their differences for now in order to bring down the terrifying war beast. If the M\u00fbmak is slain, the other companies are all victorious. If the Harad or Far Harad player can kill all of the models from the other companiesn then they are the winner. Remember that they may only have a M\u00fbmak in these situations! It doesn't have to just be M\u00fbmakil that you allow in your own campaigns, perhaps a Gundabad player would like a Gundabad Troll, or a Rivendell player may want an Eagle to join them; so long as your campaign participants agree on conditions to balance and justify it, it can be great fun to do!</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/additional_rules/#playing-two-against-one","title":"PLAYING TWO AGAINST ONE","text":"<p>As a campaign goes on, you will often find that some Battle Companies' Ratings start to soar, whilst others seem to struggle to advance so far no matter how many Influence Points they gain from the Against the Odds bonus.</p> <p>One way of counteracting this is to allow games where it is two against one, when the Battle Company Rating is roughly equal on both sides. For example, if two players with a Rating of 150 play against one player who has a rating of 300 that would, in theory, be a fair fight. This will provide the two lower Battle Companies a fair chance of knocking the other company down a peg or two, whilst providing them with a decent challenge along the way. If you do decide to do this, you should count the Ratings of both allied Battle Companies as one for the purposes of working out the Against the Odds bonus.</p> <p>Hopefully, you have found some of these additional rules to be fun and interesting; perhaps they have inspired you to add them to your own campaign, or even to think of some of your own ideas to use to enhance the narrative stories that your games of Battle Companies create.

From lush and vibrant forests to the ruined Dwarven kingdoms of old to humble fishing settlements, a Battle Company can be forced to engage in a skirmish in almost any place \u2014 and must be ready to take up their weapons at a moment's notice.</p> <p>Over the next few pages we will present a series of rules for fighting your battles in a variety of different locations in Middle-earth. Some of these represent specific places, such as Lake-town or Goblin-town, whilst many could represent a multitude of places across Middle-earth. For example, forests could be used to represent Mirkwood, Fangorn and many more.</p> <p>The rules provided here are by no means exhaustive, but some of them can be applied to various Scenarios during the Narrative Campaign found on page 92. If you want to create your own rules for fighting battles in other locations, feel free to try your hand at it. Creating your own rules for other locations can provide a very personal feel to your games of Battle Companies, and can make every game feel unique.</p> <p>Also, some of the rules for these locations can provide a great basis for other areas of Middle-earth.

Her former strongholds and rich cities are now nothing more than piles of rubble, haunted by the chilling voices of those that once ruled them. It has even been said that Evil spirits lurk within the crumbling stone, bound to the dark powers that once conquered their lands.</p> <p>Often, Battle Companies will venture into these ruined places in search of riches or items of great power from ages long since past, unaware of the perils they are wandering into. For the spirits that dwell within the haunted ruins see the members of a Battle Company as easy targets to sacrifice in the name of the dark power that binds them.</p> <p>Games that take place within Haunted Ruins should feature a wide selection of different buildings, ruins and similar. All of these are subject to the following rules:</p> <p>CHILLING AURA \u2014 Though it was once a proud building of a noble kingdom now long forgotten, it is hard to deny the chilling feeling that those pure of heart sense whilst within its walls.</p> <p>Good models within a Haunted Ruin suffer a -1 penalty to their Courage value whilst within it.</p> <p>SPIRITS OF THOSE LONG DEAD \u2014 As rival Battle Companies fight amongst the ruins, the twisted, lingering spirit of the realm's former king has been stirred and now seeks to exact his revenge upon those that have entered his domain.</p> <p>For any game featuring Haunted Ruins, players will need a number of identical markers equal to the number of ruins on the board, one of which should be marked underneath. The markers should be randomised and one should be placed in each ruin so that neither player knows which one is marked. The first time a model moves within a ruin, flip the marker over. If it is unmarked, nothing happens, remove it from play. If it is marked, the model has disturbed the restless spirit within the ruin. Immediately place a Barrow-wight within the centre of the ruin. The Barrow-wight will always move first in each Move phase, even before Heroic Moves, and will charge the nearest model from either Battle Company by the shortest possible route. If this is not possible, it will move as quickly as possible towards the nearest model from either Battle Company. If, before the Barrow-wight moves, there are models within 6\" of it, the Barrow-wight will try to cast the Paralyse Magical Power using a single Will point on the closest model, so long as it has Will points remaining.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/adventures_in_middle_earth/#lake-town","title":"LAKE-TOWN","text":"<p>Upon the waters of the Long Lake sits the humble fishing settlement of Esgaroth, a meagre town filled with impoverished people. Even in its relative poverty, trade still manages to trickle into it, its creaking walkways dotted with stalls, markets and numerous barrels of fish, adding a pungent fishy smell to the already downtrodden settlement that resides atop the cruel and unforgiving lake.</p> <p>Although Esgaroth usually provides a 'safe' haven for travellers, it is not unheard of for opposing Battle Companies to enter into violent disagreement in one of the town's many taverns. Often these disagreements can form into fully-fledged skirmishes that will claim lives.</p> <p>DOORWAYS \u2014 The many houses that are built atop the Long Lake can provide a variety of extra pathways and shortcuts for warriors to traverse Esgaroth.</p> <p>A Man-sized (or smaller) model that starts its Move phase in base contact with a door on a Lake-town House may choose to enter the house instead of moving. The model spends its turn running through the house (no doubt knocking over chairs, tables and various other items as it goes) and is placed in base contact with any other door on the Lake-town House. A model that moves in this way counts as having moved its full Movement allowance. If the model cannot be placed in base contact with another door for whatever reason, then it cannot move in this way.</p> <p>BOATS \u2014 Many folk of Lake-town are fishermen or bargemen. As such, it is commonplace in Lake-town for most families to own a boat, which they use to fish or cross the Long Lake.</p> <p>A model may enter or exit a boat by passing a Jump test. A boat has limited space and as such only two Man-sized (or smaller) models may occupy a single boat. An unengaged model that is in a boat may row it up to 6\" in any direction upon the water. If two enemy models are in the same boat, they count as Engaged and will fight each other in the Fight phase. As models in a boat cannot Back Away, any model that loses a Duel roll whilst in a boat counts as Trapped.</p> <p>ICE FLOES \u2014 The freezing waters of the Long Lake are strewn with numerous ice floes. Although these sheets of ice provide a cunning warrior with an alternative pathway across Lake-town, even the most sure-footed can find themselves upended by the ice's treacherous surface.</p> <p>At the start of each turn, determine the direction that the lake is flowing. This can be done with a roll of a D6, letting the player with Priority choose or by using a Scatter dice. Each Ice Floe is moved D3\" in the chosen direction. Any models that moved during the Move phase and end their move on an Ice Floe must roll a D6. On a 1, that model loses its footing and falls into the lake. Any model that falls into the freezing waters is removed as a casualty.</p> <p>BARRELS \u2014 Lake-town is constantly littered with barrels containing all manner of exciting things, from fish to ale to countless other goods. A well- timed kick of one of these can knock over countless adversaries as it barrels down the streets of Esgaroth.</p> <p>A Barrel is a Heavy Object. Any model carrying a barrel may choose to kick it D6\" towards the enemy, even moving through other models. Any model that the barrel moves through must roll a D6. On a 1-2, the model is immediately knocked Prone and suffers a Strength 1 hit. Place the Barrel where it finishes its movement \u2014 it gives your opponent the chance to kick it right back! Barrels that enter the Long Lake are removed from play.</p> <p>FISH BASKETS \u2014 Esgaroth is a fishing settlement, and as such, baskets and barrels of recent catches can be seen on almost every street corner and table. A well-placed slap with a fish will disorientate anyone who is on the receiving end of the slimy makeshift weapon.</p> <p>If a model that is in base contact with a Fish Basket wins a Duel roll, they may choose to slap one enemy model with a fish instead of making Strikes. Any model that is slapped with a fish suffers a Strength 1 hit. Additionally, they may not move during the following Move phase and are reduced to Fight 1/6+ until the End phase of the following turn.</p> <p>LANTERNS \u2014 When the skies turn dark, the streets of Lake-town are dotted with lanterns that light up its streets, outlining the edges of the walkways for the townsfolk.</p> <p>Many of the Scenarios in Lake-town take place at night. When this is the case, models can only see other models that are within 12\" of them. A model within 3\" of a Lantern can be targeted at any distance.</p> <p>SLIPPERY WALKWAYS \u2014 The walkways of Lake-town are constantly wet from the waters of the Long Lake, not to mention the fish that often litter the streets, which causes them to become slippery and dangerous for those fighting atop them.</p> <p>Whenever a model Backs Away as a result of losing a  Duel roll, it must roll a D6. On a 1, that model slips on a particularly wet piece of wood (or potentially a stray fish) and is knocked Prone. Note that this happens before Strikes are made, which means that any model that slips will therefore be Prone when its opponent makes its Strikes!</p> <p>FENDERS \u2014 These lightweight wicker objects are designed to prevent boats from crashing into the docks. However, they can also be used to deliver a swift thwack to an enemy in times of desperation.</p> <p>A Fender is a Light Object. At any point during its Move phase, a model carrying a Fender may use it to hit a single enemy model within 1\" of itself. On a 4+, the model hit with a Fender is knocked Prone.</p> <p>OUTHOUSES \u2014 An outhouse can make for a very good, albeit smelly, hiding place (not many people are inconsiderate enough to enter an outhouse while its door is shut!), and can conceal its occupant from enemies that traverse Lake-town.</p> <p>During the Move phase, a Man-sized (or smaller) model that is in base contact with the door of an unoccupied Outhouse may choose to enter it. Whilst within an Outhouse, a model cannot be targeted or seen by enemy models and has no Control Zone. Models inside an Outhouse cannot draw Line of Sight and therefore may not Shoot, cast Magical Powers or use any special rules that target a specific enemy or friendly model. They may, however, Charge out of an Outhouse as if they did have Line of Sight from the door of the Outhouse.</p> <p>Each Move phase, a single model may attempt to open the Outhouse door, revealing anyone hiding inside by being in base contact and rolling a D6. On a 6, the model inside has been found and is subsequently charged by the model that found it. As there is nowhere to Back Away to in an Outhouse, if the model inside loses a Duel roll, it will automatically be Trapped.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/adventures_in_middle_earth/#forests","title":"FORESTS","text":"<p>Middle-earth is strewn with numerous forests and woodlands with histories stretching back as far as records, or memories, recall. Each of these forests is different, with each harbouring its own secrets and dangers from the wider world.

At the start of the game, before deployment, players should roll to see which of the forests of Middle-earth they are fighting in \u2014 or simply choose from the list if there is one that particularly suits your game. All pieces of woodland terrain will automatically be of the same type, depending on the result of the D6.</p> D6 Result 1 NORMAL FOREST  Normal Forests have no additional rules. 2 HAUNTED FOREST (ANGMAR)  At the start of each Move phase, randomly select D3 pieces of woodland terrain. The closest model to each of the selected pieces must pass a Courage test or suffer the effects of the Transfix Magical Power. 3 SPIDER-INFESTED FOREST (MIRKWOOD)  At the end of each Move phase, randomly select one piece of woodland terrain on the board and place a single Mirkwood Spider within the centre (or as close as possible). This Mirkwood Spider will then move as fast as it can towards the nearest model from either Battle Company, Charging if possible. If the Mirkwood Spider is not in combat during the Shoot phase, it may shoot its Spider Webs at the closest visible model if it is in range. 4 GUARDED FOREST (DR\u00daADAN, NORTHERN FORESTS)  During each Shoot phase, roll a D6 for each model either in a piece of woodland terrain or within 3\" of one. On a 1 or 2, that model suffers a Strength 2 hit as if it was shot with a bow from the edge of the woodland terrain closest to the model. If there are any In The Way rolls to be made, such as if the model is in combat, or if there is other terrain or models in the arrow's path then any In The Way rolls will still need to be made. 5 WRATHFUL FOREST (FANGORN, OLD FOREST)  At the start of each Move phase, roll a D6 for each model in base contact with or within a piece of woodland terrain. On a 1 or 2, that model suffers a Strength 6 hit as the trees lash out against them. 6 HAVEN FOREST (LOTHL\u00d3RIEN)  Any Evil model that is even partially within a Haven Forest suffers a penalty of -1 to their Courage value while they remain within it."},{"location":"battle_companies/adventures_in_middle_earth/#goblin-town","title":"GOBLIN-TOWN","text":"<p>Beneath The Misty Mountains, further north than the kingdom of Moria, is the dismal dwelling of Goblin- town.

Yet as the ages rolled on, some began to fall into ruin, either attacked and overrun by Goblins and Orcs, or even taken by some form of darker power altogether. It was precisely this that saw the greatest kingdom of the Dwarves fall. The Dwarves of Khazad-d\u00fbm delved too greedily and too deep, awakening a Balrog of Morgoth and thus sealing their doom.</p> <p>If a Battle Company needs to cross The Misty Mountains, and doesn't fancy passing too close to the threats posed by Goblin-town, they may risk the road through Khazad-d\u00fbm \u2014 or the black pit of Moria as it has hence become known.

There are plenty of options for your company members to spend their hard earned Influence Points on, from mounts to weapons and armour.</p> <p>The list presented on the next page is by no means exhaustive; certain Battle Companies may have their own list of additional wargear that can be bought for them. Where this is the case it will be presented on that Battle Company's page, along with any costs associated with that piece of wargear.</p> <p>There are a few restrictions to which pieces of wargear can be purchased for the members of your Battle Company. This is to ensure that the Battle Companies progress in a thematic manner that fits with their background, rather than simply loading every model in your Battle Company with wargear they would not really have access to.</p> <p>For the Warrior models in your Battle Company, this is really easy to work out. They can simply purchase any piece of wargear that model's profile would normally be able to have. For example, a Warrior of Minas Tirith from a Battle Company would be able to buy a bow, shield or spear, as those options are directly available to their profile. They would not be able to buy a horse, lance or Elf bow, as those options are not available to their profile.</p> <p>Hero models are much less limited by which pieces of wargear they can take. They can purchase any piece of wargear that is available to any member of their Battle Company, including those that could be promoted or join as Reinforcements; but not those that joined the Battle Company by other means (such as Wanderers or those from the Narrative Campaign). If a member of your Battle Company happens to gain a piece of wargear that they could not normally have through a Narrative Campaign, this does not mean that your Hero models may also purchase the same type of wargear.</p> <p>Next to each wargear entry are two numbers in brackets separated by a slash. These denote the amount of points that the piece of wargear will add to a Hero model as explained on page 9.</p> <p>For example: Jay has a Minas Tirith Battle Company and wants to purchase some wargear for his leader. Jay may purchase a horse for his leader as the Knights of Minas Tirith can have a horse. He could also purchase a longbow, as Citadel Guard can have a longbow. Jay could not purchase a two-handed weapon for his leader as no member of his Battle Company is able to have a two-handed weapon.</p> <ul> <li>ARMOURED HORSE (8/15) [4 Influence Points]</li> <li>BOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>CROSSBOW (2/5) [2 Influence Points]</li> <li>DWARF BOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>DWARF LONGBOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>ELF BOW (2/5) [2 Influence Points]</li> <li>ELVEN-MADE HAND-AND-A-HALF SWORD (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>ESGAROTH BOW (2/5) [2 Influence Points]</li> <li>FELL WARG (5/10) [3 Influence Points]</li> <li>HORSE (5/10) [3 Influence Points]</li> <li>LANCE (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>LONGBOW (2/5) [2 Influence Points]</li> <li>ORC BOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>PIKE (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>SHIELD (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>SHORT BOW (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>SPEAR (1/5) [1 Influence Point]</li> <li>SWAP HAND WEAPON FOR ANOTHER TYPE (1/5) [1 Influence Point] </li> </ul> <p>Any model may change the type of hand weapon they possess for any of the following: axe, club, dagger, flail, hammer, mace, maul, pick, scourge, staff, or sword.

Some of these pieces of Equipment can only be purchased by certain Battle Companies, only by Hero models, or sometimes only by Good or Evil models. When this is the case, it will be clearly stated. Each piece of Equipment has a number in brackets after its name; this is the number of points it will add onto the rating of your Battle Company (see page 9).</p> <ul> <li>ARROW POISON SMALL (1) [1 Influence Point]</li> </ul> <p>A tactic made famous by the Haradrim of the south, many Evil creatures will coat the tips of their arrows in poison to cause great pain to those that succumb to its potency.</p> <p>A model with Arrow Poison must re-roll To Wound rolls of a 1 when making a shooting attack.

Only Evil models may purchase Blade Poison.</p> <ul> <li>CLIMBING ROPES SMALL (1) [1 Influence Point]</li> </ul> <p>Along their travels, members of a Battle Company will have to traverse many areas that need to be climbed, making ropes an essential piece of equipment.</p> <p>A model with Climbing Ropes will add +1 to any Climb tests they make. Additionally, after the model makes a Climb test they may choose to leave their rope behind. If they do so they cannot use it for the rest of the game, mark the location with a marker, counter or token. Any friendly model that makes a Climb test from the same point also gains a bonus of +1 to the result. At the end of the game, the model is assumed to retrieve the rope.</p> <ul> <li>COMPANY STANDARD LARGE (10) [6 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>It is not unheard of for some Battle Companies to carry the colours of their lord with them on their journeys. The sight of a standard flapping in the wind inspires courage in all who see it.</p> <p>Any member of the same Battle Company as a model carrying a Company Standard, that can draw Line of Sight to the Company Standard itself, may re-roll any failed Courage tests.

Leaders of a Battle Company will often provide their comrades with such a drink, and the promise of one can bring out the best in almost any fighter.</p> <p>A Hero model may elect to use their Dwarven Brew at the start of any game, if they do so it has been used and is removed from the Hero model's profile. Every model within the Hero model's Battle Company adds +1 to their Courage value for the remainder of the game.</p> <ul> <li>ELVISH WAYBREAD SMALL (3) [3 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>Made by the Elves in anticipation of long journeys, Elvish waybread, or Lembas as it is often known, is an enchanted food that strengthens those that eat it for the roads ahead. It is said to be even better than the honey-cakes of the Beornings and that even a small amount can prepare a Man for a full day's march.</p> <p>A model that has purchased Elvish Waybread may elect to use it at the end of any game in which they were removed as a casualty. If they do this, remove the Elvish Waybread from their Equipment; additionally, do not roll on the Injury chart for them, instead they will automatically count as having rolled the Full Recovery result. Only Good models may purchase Elvish Waybread.</p> <ul> <li>HEALING HERBS (HERO ONLY) SMALL (3) [3 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>There are many flora and fungi in Middle-earth that have healing or medicinal properties. Those with the right knowledge can use such plants to slow the wounds suffered by their allies, or even help them to recover from otherwise fatal injuries.</p> <p>A Hero may elect to use their Healing Herbs at the end of any game if they were not removed as a casualty.

If they do this, instead of rolling To Wound, roll a single D6 instead. On a 4+, the enemy Man-sized or smaller model suffers the effects of the Paralyse Magical Power, as it has been bound.</p> <ul> <li>MAP (HERO ONLY) SMALL (3) [3 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>Few warriors in Middle-earth have the skill to read the ancient maps of Middle-earth; yet those who can are a valuable addition to any Battle Company.</p> <p>After both Battle Companies have deployed, before the first Priority is rolled, a Battle Company with a Map may redeploy D6 models using the normal rules. If both players have a Map, the player with Priority redeploys their models first.</p> <ul> <li>RALLYING HORN SMALL (5) [5 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>The blast of this horn will alert the bearer's allies to their location, allowing them to stick together against their enemies.</p> <p>If one or more models with a Rallying Horn are on the board, their Battle Company may add 1 (or minus 1) to any Reinforcement rolls in the Secure the Area Scenario.

Upon hearing these words spoken aloud, your company is infused with reinvigorated courage.</p> <p>At the start of any game, the Hero may read the Scroll of Courage. If they do, all friendly models add +1 to their Courage value for the remainder of the game. Once read, the scroll is caught by a strong breeze and floats off into the air; remove it from the Hero model's Equipment.</p> <ul> <li>SCROLL OF HIDDEN PATHS (HERO ONLY) SMALL (2) [4 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>Found upon your company's travels, this mysterious scroll contains the locations of a series of hidden paths that lead to the battlefield.</p> <p>At the start of any game, before forces are deployed, the Hero may read the Scroll of Hidden Paths. If they do, you may keep D3 Warrior models off the board when deploying your forces. These models will arrive from any board edge of your choosing at the end of your company's second Move phase via the rules for Reinforcements. Once read, the scroll is caught by a strong breeze and floats off into the air; remove it from the Hero model's Equipment.</p> <ul> <li>SEEING STONE (HERO ONLY) SMALL (5) [6 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>This mysterious stone swirls with an unknown power. Quite what power it possesses remains uncertain, but those who wield it seem to know what may happen before it comes to pass.</p> <p>At the start of each turn that the Hero is alive, roll a D6 before Priority is rolled. On the roll of a natural 6, the Hero may choose which side has Priority that turn.</p> <ul> <li>TORCH SMALL(1) [1 Influence Point]</li> </ul> <p>Warriors will use torches to light the way in caves or the dark of night. They can also be unconventional yet effective weapons in times of great desperation.</p> <p>A model with a Torch illuminates the area within 6\" of them; models within this area can be seen as if it were daylight. Additionally, a model with a Torch can use it to attempt to set their foes on fire. If this model wins a Duel roll, they may choose to not make any Strikes and instead roll a D6. On a 6, the model that lost the Duel roll suffers the Set Ablaze special rule.</p> <ul> <li>WAR DRUM LARGE (10) [3 Influence Points]</li> </ul> <p>Many bands of Orcs, Uruk-hai or other Evil beings will march into battle to the rhythmic beat of a war drum, the constant thumping of the drum making sure that no member of the company slows down and falls behind.</p> <p>At the start of the Move phase, a model with a War Drum may declare they are sounding the advance. When this occurs, all models from the same Battle Company, and within 12\" of the drummer, add 3\" to their Movement value if on foot and 5\" to their Movement if mounted for the remainder of the turn. Models that are affected by a War Drum may not Charge in that turn. Only Evil models may purchase a War Drum.</p> <ul> <li>WHIP SMALL (2) [1 Influence Point]</li> </ul> <p>Among the Evil races of Middle-earth, whips are used to viciously spur on the rank and file into battle. More than once has a disobedient Orc felt the sting of these cruel weapons.</p> <p>A Whip counts as a throwing weapon with a range of 2\" and Strength 1.

Remove the Hero, and all of their wargear, from your Battle Company Roster. 3 Lost in Battle \u2014 The Hero lies wounded upon the field of battle; their followers either unable to find them or having mistaken them for one of the fallen. The Hero model's Battle Company must play the Secure the Area or A Daring Rescue Scenario as their next game with the lost Hero as the objective. In the Secure the Area scenario, the Hero may not act in any way, shape or form, and may not be charged, targeted or damaged in any way (they are essentially an Objective marker). If the lost Hero model's Battle Company is victorious in the Scenario, then the Hero is rescued and makes a Full Recovery. If the game is a draw, then the Hero is rescued but must miss the next game their company participates in. If, however, they are defeated then the Hero is captured and considered Dead. 4 Arm Wound \u2014 The Hero has taken a serious wound to one of their arms, rendering it all but useless. From this point on, the Hero cannot carry a shield, wield a two-handed weapon, use a hand-and-a-half weapon two-handed, or fire a bow or crossbow of any sort (though they may still use throwing weapons). They may only use single-handed weapons from this point forward. Should the Hero suffer another Arm Wound at any point, they will be forced to retire, as per the Dead result. 5 Leg Wound \u2014 The Hero has sustained a vicious injury to their leg, causing them to limp and become slower as a result. The Hero has their Move value permanently reduced by 1\". Should the Hero suffer another Leg Wound at any point, they will be forced to retire, as per the Dead result. 6-8 Full Recovery \u2014 Fortune has been kind, the injuries suffered are of no lasting effect. The Hero may play in the next game as normal. Additionally, the Hero heals one Leg Wound, Arm Wound or Old Battle Wound they previously obtained. 9 It's just a Scratch \u2014 Although not life threatening, the Hero must rest in order to heal. They must miss the next game. Alternatively, the Hero may roll again on this chart \u2014 however, the second result will apply even if it is worse than the first. 10 Old Battle Wound \u2014 Although the Hero essentially makes a Full Recovery, they will never really be the same. The wounds that they suffered in battle will crop up from time to time, rendering the Hero unable to fight. At the start of each game this Hero participates in, roll a D6. On a 1, the Hero must miss that game. It is possible for a Hero to have multiple Old Battle Wounds, in which case they will roll a D6 for each one. 11 The Wounds of a Hero \u2014 The Hero's allies are so impressed by the Hero's resilience and quick recovery that they are richly rewarded. The Hero model's Battle Company immediately gains an extra D6 Influence Points; additionally, the Hero makes a Full Recovery. 12 Protected by the Valar \u2014 Saved by the Valar, or perhaps some darker force, the Hero is protected from harm. The Hero makes a Full Recovery. Additionally, the Hero permanently gains +1 Fate point (to a maximum of 3). <p>As you will no doubt have noticed, Hero models are less likely to die than Warrior models.

Players are free to use any Battle Company they wish, though we feel the campaign works best when each player uses a different company; that way each player is representing a different faction or region, which adds to the excitement of the campaign.</p> <p>We recommend between 4-10 players for this campaign, as that way the map does not get too crowded and each faction has room to expand their own territories. However, this is by no means a hard and fast rule, and if you want to have more players in the campaign, that is absolutely fine \u2014 just be prepared for some companies to be right on top of each other from the start!</p> <p>Once you have gathered your players and they have chosen their Battle Companies, each player will need to choose their starting location. These are all spaces in the wilderness of Middle-earth where your Battle Company currently resides, and are denoted on the map by the shaded yellow hexes and the  symbol. As there are only 10 of these starting locations on the map, if you have more than 10 players in your campaign, you will have to agree on some other starting locations for the extra players.</p> <p>When selecting starting locations, randomly determine an order for players to choose them in. The first player may select any of the starting locations; the second player may then choose any of the remaining starting locations, and so on until each player has a starting location for their Battle Company. Once every player has chosen where their company will start, you are ready to play!</p> <p>The map-based campaign is played using a series of turns, each of which is made up of a number of phases as explained below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Campaign turn begins</p> </li> <li> <p>Expansion phase</p> </li> <li> <p>Battle phase</p> </li> <li> <p>Consolidation phase</p> </li> <li> <p>Turn ends</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"battle_companies/map_based_campaigns/#expansion-phase","title":"EXPANSION PHASE","text":"<p>At the start of each campaign turn, each player's Battle Company gets the chance to expand the number of territories that they own.

If certain players are battling over specific territories, and both of them wish to fight each other, this can be a good reason to have them fighting \u2014 just be careful not just to do this every turn, as doing so will mean they only ever play each other rather than the rest of the group.</p> <p>The most important thing is to ensure that every player has a game, that way one player doesn't just race off and play everyone first so that their Battle Company becomes far more experienced than everyone else's.

Jay could choose to take control of territory A as he was victorious and it is currently unoccupied. Jay could also choose to take control of either territory B or territory C as both are owned by Ben, who Jay has just defeated in the previous game. Jay could not choose to take control of territory D as it is owned by Adam's Easterling Battle Company and, although he was victorious, Jay would need to defeat Adam specifically to lay claim to that territory.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/map_based_campaigns/#winning-the-campaign","title":"WINNING THE CAMPAIGN","text":"<p>When you start a campaign, you will need to determine when the end point will be so that you can establish an eventual winner.

There are Battle Companies to represent most of the numerous different factions, kingdoms and alliances from all over Middle-earth, so we are confident that you will be able to find one that suits your particular tastes. </p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/mustering_your_warband/#step-1-gather-your-force","title":"STEP 1 \u2014 GATHER YOUR FORCE","text":"<p>This book contains 38 different Battle Companies from all parts of Middle-earth. From the White City of Minas Tirith to the arid deserts of Harad, and from the rolling hills of the Shire to the cavernous halls of Moria, you will find Battle Companies to represent almost all of the fighting forces of Middle-earth from page 30 onwards. Each Battle Company has a section of background introducing them, how their companies are formed and what their goals are. Each entry also has its own starting Battle Company, a list of the Advancements available to members of that company, Reinforcements chart(s), and a unique special rule that is only available to the Heroes from that company.</p> <p>After you have chosen the Battle Company that you are going to use, you can gather all of the models you need for your starting company; detailed on the Battle Company's specific page. You should then write down all of the members of your company, including all of their wargear, on your roster sheet \u2014 a copy of this can be found on pages 126-127 and can be printed for your own personal use.</p> <p>It is a good idea to give each member of your company a name, that way it makes it much easier to record what each of them has accomplished. It also allows the members of your company to develop their own character and personality, and allows you to follow the stories that unfold as your company embarks on adventures and partakes in battles; celebrating their achievements and mourning their losses. Some people also paint the names of their company members on the bases of their models so they can easily identify them at a glance.</p> <p>Once you have chosen which Battle Company you are going to play, and gathered together all the various models you will need, the next thing to do is to select the Heroes of your company. When you start a Battle Company you will be able to select three of its members to become Heroes; they will each get a single point each of Might, Will and Fate, and will be treated as Hero models for all intents and purposes. Next, you will need to choose one of your Hero models to be the leader of your company; the other two become your leader's Sergeants. If, at any point during a Battle Companies campaign, your leader is slain, choose one of your Sergeants to be promoted to the leader of the Battle Company after the battle. If you ever have less than two Sergeants remaining, another Hero in your company, who is not already a leader or Sergeant, may become a Sergeant. Regardless of the number of Hero models in your Battle Company, you may only ever have a maximum of one leader and two Sergeants.</p> <p>It is also worth pointing out that the leader and Sergeants of your Battle Company are new Hero models, and as such are only able to use the universal Heroic Actions and not the specialised Heroic Actions \u2014 though they may gain access to some of these as they progress.</p> <p>Throughout your games and adventures in Middle-earth, your Battle Company will have a chance to recruit more members and swell in size. However, your Battle Company may not normally exceed a total of 15 models \u2014 though there are a few rare exceptions to this rule. Additionally, only 33% of the total members of your Battle Company can have bows unless otherwise stated. If your Battle Company cannot include any more models armed with bows, and a Reinforcement roll would provide your company with a model armed with a bow, choose a lower result on the same chart that suits your needs.</p> <p>Some models available to Battle Companies are classed as rare units; this means that a Battle Company can only ever have a certain number of them. When this is the case, it will be presented after the model's name in brackets stating Rare X, where X is the maximum number of that model available. For example, if a model has (Rare 1) after it, a Battle Company would only ever be allowed to have one of them. If a model has (Rare 2) after it, then a Battle Company could have a maximum of two, and so on. If your Battle Company cannot include any more Rare models, and a Reinforcement roll would provide your company with a Rare model, choose a lower result on the same chart that suits your needs.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/mustering_your_warband/#step-2-play-a-game","title":"STEP 2 \u2014 PLAY A GAME","text":"<p>Once you have collected your Battle Company together, and given them all suitably Middle-earth sounding names, the next thing to do is find an opponent to play against \u2014 a rather vital thing when you are playing a game!

On pages 70-83 you will find a selection of 18 different Scenarios specially designed for Battle Companies for you to choose from. Some of these will be completely even for each side, with both trying to accomplish the same goals; whilst others will require one force to be the Attacker whilst the other force is the Defender.

In the Narrative Scenarios, your Battle Company will face a pre-determined force that will provide the essence of the campaign, and each one will be slightly harder than the last to ensure that your company is always challenged, even as they progress.</p> <p>The campaign has been written with Good Battle Companies in mind; however, this does not mean you cannot use an Evil Battle Company instead. Each Scenario will have a \"What if I'm using an Evil Battle Company?\" section at the end of it to account for this. For all of you out there who are champions of darkness, fear not! Keep an eye out for an Evil themed campaign in a future publication.</p> <p>Once you have gathered together your group of friends to play the campaign, and all chosen your respective Battle Companies (it works best if everyone has a different one), you can all begin the campaign. The first Scenario you will all need to play is Skirmish in Bree; this is designed to be played with a starting Battle Company and will provide the beginning of the story your Battle Companies will be taking part in.</p> <p>Each player should play this as their first game to give everyone the same opportunities to gather extra Equipment for their company. It is also a good idea to get another player to use the opposing force in each of the Narrative Scenarios, which will make the games far more interesting. The best way to go about this is for everyone to pair up with a partner and play two games; one player using the company whilst the other uses the opposing force, and then swapping over.</p> <p>After this we recommend playing at least one, but up to three, Battle Companies games between the members of your group before moving on to the second Narrative Scenario. As the Narrative Scenarios get progressively harder, this will allow you to progress the members of your company enough to successfully undertake each Scenario in turn \u2014 and as the Scenarios do get harder, this is rather sensible to do!

Weary from their travels, the company decides to pay a visit to the Prancing Pony in order to rest, restock their supplies, and enjoy good food and ale (all good stories begin in the pub, after all). The company are met with strange glances and muttering under breath; those within the tavern are unused to strangers in their lands and are suspicious of the group.</p> <p>Not wanting to draw too much attention, the company finds a quiet corner of the Pony to sit down in and begin to talk amongst themselves about their finds from their most recent outing.

Whilst many of the Breelanders ignore the company, the odd one or two listen intently, hanging on every word.</p> <p>Amid the raucous singing and tales of grandeur, the leader of your company is approached by an old man leaning heavily upon his walking stick. The man's face is mostly concealed by a long grey beard and faint blue hood that matched the robes he is clothed in. Though he appears frail, the man speaks with authority; his voice commanding great respect.

The company engages in much discussion about the likelihood of this story being true, and if so, what they should do. In the end, they decide that if the treasure is even half of what the tales say, then it is simply too much to ignore and leave in the northern mountains. They decide to venture north and lay claim to the treasure for their masters, and the glories that go with it.</p> <p>Sending a message home to their lord, the company orders another round of ale, from a now very tired Barliman Butterbur, and begin laying the plans for their long journey to the very north of the Blue Mountains...</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/scenarios/","title":"Scenarios","text":"<p>Once you have gathered your force and found yourself an opponent, it is time to decide which of the Battle Company Scenarios you should play.

It often makes for a good game if both players use their Battle Company as part of a larger force from the same faction, that way it feels as if your company has joined their kinsmen upon the battlefield and that all of their adventures have been leading up to this one final defining moment.</p> <p>If you are playing an Open Play game, this is really simple. Just decide on what you want your game to be, and the forces that your companies are going to fight alongside and get going! Perhaps your company has to hold an area of the battlefield whilst their allies are trying to rescue them. Maybe your company has led a larger army to an enemy outpost and now they must join them as they try to capture it from their foes. Whatever story you come up with, Open Play lends itself perfectly to using your Battle Companies in larger games.</p> <p>You can also use your Battle Company in friendly Matched Play games with your friends. Simply work out the points value of your Battle Company, using the system outlined on page 9, and the company will cost that many points for a Matched Play game. Using your Battle Company in Matched Play games can throw up some interesting Scenarios for you to play. For example, perhaps you want to pit your company against a force of an equal points value and see how they fare. You could do this by finding an enemy Hero of a similar points cost to your leader and pit them against each other to see who would come out on top.</p> <p>When playing a Matched Play game using your Battle Company, there are a few additional things you should note as you play:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When deploying your Battle Company, treat the whole company as a single warband, with the company's leader as the captain of the warband. Ignore the other rules and restrictions for building a warband when doing this.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your Battle Company will count as being from the same army list as where their Hero and Warrior models are from for the purposes of Allies and whether the army will receive its Army Bonus. For example, a Minas Tirith Battle Company will count as being from the Minas Tirith army list, and a K\u00e2rna Battle Company will count as being from the Serpent Horde army list.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a Battle Company has models from more than one army list then the company will count as being from the army list that the leader of the company would normally be from. For example, a Men of the West Battle Company with a Warrior of Rohan as the leader would count as being from the Rohan army list; a Men of the West Battle Company with a Knight of Dol Amroth as the leader would count as being from the Fiefdoms army list.</p> </li> <li> <p>The leader of your Battle Company will always count as a Hero of Fortitude for the purposes of working out the leader of your overall army.</p> </li> <li> <p>Members of your Battle Company may still generate Experience Points in the same ways as described on page  7. </p> </li> <li> <p>Any members of your Battle Company that were removed as a casualty will still suffer Injuries, and therefore roll on the relevant Injury chart, as they would in normal Battle Companies games as described on page 10.</p> </li> <li> <p>Battle Companies are not designed to be used in tournament or competition play, only in friendly Matched Play games.</p> </li> </ul> <p>On the next page is an additional Matched Play Scenario that you can use if only one player is using a Battle Company, and on pages 116-117 is a Scenario that you can use if both players are using their Battle Companies in a game.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/wars_aftermath/","title":"War's Aftermath","text":"<p>Following each game of Battle Companies, both sides will have a few things to work out.

The only way that a mount can be permanently lost is if the model riding it dies, in which case it is removed from your Battle Company along with all of their other wargear and possessions. </p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/wars_aftermath/#step-2-experience","title":"STEP 2 \u2014 EXPERIENCE","text":"<p>Once you have resolved all of the Injuries that your Battle Company has suffered, it is time to work out how many Experience Points the members of your Battle Company have earned, and if any of them have gained enough to potentially progress and improve their skills. Experience is gained in a variety of ways, the most common of which are listed below, and is used to calculate when the members of your Battle Company are ready to improve.</p> <p>Hero and Warrior models gain Experience Points in slightly different ways.</p> <p>HERO EXPERIENCE</p> <p>Hero models gain Experience Points in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Each time the Hero causes a Wound on an enemy model, even if it is subsequently prevented by Fate, they will gain +1 Experience Point.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each time the Hero participates in a battle, they will gain +1 Experience Point.Each time the Hero model's Battle Company wins a Scenario that they participated in, they will gain +1 Experience Point.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each time a Hero gains 5 Experience Points, they may roll on any of the Hero Progression charts that are available to them. All of these charts, along with any restrictions as to which Hero models may roll on them, are listed on pages 14-17.</p> </li> </ul> <p>WARRIOR EXPERIENCE</p> <p>Warrior models gain Experience Points in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For each game in which the Warrior causes one or more Wounds on enemy models, even if they are subsequently prevented by Fate, they will gain +1 Experience Point.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each time the Warrior participates in a battle, they will gain +1 Experience Point.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Whenever a Warrior gains 5 Experience Points, they may roll on the Warrior Progression chart found on page 12.</p> <p>No member of a Battle Company may have more than 105 Experience Points. Should a model reach this lofty total, they cannot increase any further \u2014 they have got as good as they can get!</p> <p>Some Scenarios may have extra ways to generate Experience during the game. Where this is the case, it will be clearly listed in the Scenario.</p> <p>If, during a battle, two or more models win a Duel roll and the number of Wounds inflicted exceeds the enemy model's total number of Wounds, the controlling player can choose which friendly model actually caused the fatal Wound and therefore gains the Experience Point.</p> <p>For example: Two Orc Warriors are in combat with a Warrior of Minas Tirith. They win the Duel roll and both score a Wound. As the Warrior of Minas Tirith only has 1 Wound, only one of the Wounds inflicted can count for the purposes of gaining Experience. The player controlling the Orcs chooses which of the Orc Warriors (it cannot be both) has slain the Warrior of Minas Tirith. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/wars_aftermath/#step-3-influence","title":"STEP 3 \u2014 INFLUENCE","text":"<p>Now that you have sorted out your Injuries and Experience, it is time to move onto Influence. This represents the allies of a Battle Company providing them with aid; whether it is Lord Denethor sending reinforcements to a Gondor company embroiled in battle, The Elvenking providing extra provisions to a band of Elves as they roam the pathways of Mirkwood, or Sauron bolstering his forces in Mordor \u2014 it is Influence that we use to represent this. The more victories the Battle Company earns, the more resources their allies will send to them in the form of Influence.</p> <p>A Battle Company will always gain 2 Influence Points for participating in a Scenario. Additionally, players receive the following:</p> <ul> <li>+1 Influence Point for a Draw</li> <li>+2 Influence Points for a Win</li> </ul> <p>There are three ways for you to spend your hard-earned Influence Points following a battle:</p> <p>REINFORCEMENTS</p> <p>The first way you can spend your Influence Points is to roll on your Battle Company's Reinforcement chart. This will bring in new members to your company, sent by the lords or rulers that your company is sworn to. Each Battle Company has its own unique Reinforcement chart, which can be found on the Battle Company's own page. These will detail which models you can potentially recruit to your company, and what you need to roll to do so. It costs 3 Influence Points to roll on a Reinforcement chart, so make sure you spend them wisely!</p> <p>ADJUST A REINFORCEMENT ROLL</p> <p>The second way you can spend Influence Points is to adjust a roll you have made on a Reinforcement chart. This works in a similar way to using Might points to adjust the score on a D6, in that for each Influence Point spent in this way you may increase the result of your Reinforcement roll by 1. Note that unlike Might points, spent Influence Points do not carry over to a second roll should there be one. Only a maximum of 3 Influence Points can be spent in this manner per Reinforcement roll.</p> <p>PURCHASE ITEMS FROM THE ARMOURY</p> <p>The final way that you can spend Influence Points is to buy additional equipment and wargear for the Hero and Warrior models within your Battle Company.</p> <p>You may buy all manner of things for your Battle Company from the Armoury on pages 18-29, including wargear, Equipment, Wanderers and Creatures, for the cost given in Influence Points.</p> <p>Warrior models may only purchase wargear that is directly available to them; if you are unsure what your Warrior models may take, simply check their profile in the relevant Army book to find out what options they have.</p> <p>Hero models are much less limited by what wargear they may purchase, and may take any piece of wargear available to any member of their Battle Company. This is explained in more detail on page 18.</p> <p>Unlike wargear, Equipment is not as restricted as to which members of your Battle Company can take what. In the Armoury is a list of all of the Equipment options, as well as a list of Wanderers and Creatures, you can purchase for your Battle Company. These can all be purchased for the members of your company, but will be lost if the owner is slain.</p> <p>Models in your Battle Company cannot swap wargear between each other. However, any model may freely discard any wargear they are currently equipped with.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/wars_aftermath/#step-4-calculate-your-battlecompanys-rating","title":"STEP 4 \u2014 CALCULATE YOUR BATTLECOMPANY'S RATING","text":"<p>After you have sorted out all of your Injuries, Experience and Influence, and the effects that has on your Battle Company, it is then time to work out your Battle Company Rating. This is a very important step as, when you play a game, the difference in Battle Company Ratings can have significant impacts on the outcome of that battle.</p> <p>Whilst at first it may seem tricky, working out your Battle Company Rating is easy, and won't take you very long following your battle \u2014 leaving even more time for another exciting encounter!</p> <p>WARRIORS</p> <p>Warrior models are simply worth the same amount in points as they are in their profile in the relevant Army book, including any wargear options they might possess.</p> <p>HEROES</p> <p>Hero models are a little more complicated to work out, but the process is still relatively simple.</p> <p>The first step you need to do is to work out the points cost of your Hero model, following the simple guide below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Every Hero started out life in Battle Companies as a Warrior of some description, so start by noting down the cost of that Warrior using the system above.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each point of Might, Will or Fate that your Hero has gained, add 5 points.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each increase to the Hero model's Fight value (do not count any change in Shoot value), Strength, Defence or Courage characteristics, add 5 points.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each increase to the Hero model's Attacks or Wounds characteristics, add 10 points.</p> </li> <li> <p>For each special rule that the Hero has gained, add 5 points.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Now that you have worked out the points cost of your Hero, you will need to work out the value of their wargear. The cost of the Hero model's wargear is dependent on the number of Attacks and Wounds the Hero has on their profile. If the number of Attacks and Wounds a Hero has adds up to a total of three or more, they will pay more for their wargear. In the Wargear section of the Armoury (page 18), every piece of wargear will be followed by a set of brackets containing two numbers separated by a slash \u2014 e.g., shield (1/5). The first number is the points cost of the piece of wargear if the Attacks and Wounds of the Hero total two or less, whilst the second number is the points cost of the piece of wargear if the Attacks and Wounds of the Hero total three or greater.</p> <p>Another important thing to note is that a Hero will not pay any points on any wargear that was built into their profile as a Warrior \u2014 that cost has already been taken into account.</p> <p>For example: A Hero who started life as a Warrior of Minas Tirith will not pay any points on their heavy armour as that came into account in the Warrior of Minas Tirith points cost, however, as a shield was bought as an option, the Hero would still pay the points cost for that as normal.</p> <p>Adelmar is Adam's Rohan Hero, and the leader of his Battle Company. Over the course of his adventures, Adelmar has gained the following profile:</p> Mv F S D A W C M W F 6\" 4/4+ 4 6 2 2 4 3 1 1 <p>WARGEAR: Heavy armour, shield &amp; sword.</p> <p>EQUIPMENT: Lucky Talisman</p> <p>SPECIAL RULES: Heroic Presence</p> <ul> <li>Adelmar started out life as a Warrior of Rohan with shield (7 points).</li> <li>He has gained +1 Fight, +1 Strength and +1 Courage (+15 points).</li> <li>He has gained +1 Attack and +1 Wound (+20 points).</li> <li>He has 3 Might points, 1 Will point and 1 Fate point (+25 points).</li> <li>He has a Lucky Talisman (+5 points).</li> <li>He has the Heroic Presence special rule (+5 points).</li> <li>As his Attacks and Wounds add up to greater than 3, he pays 5 points for his heavy armour (+5 points).</li> <li>As he started out with a shield, he is not charged for it.</li> </ul> <p>This brings Adelmar to a grand total of 82 points, making him quite an impressive Hero on the battlefield!</p> <p>One final important thing to note is that models that are missing the next game due to Injury do not count towards your Battle Company's Rating for that game.</p>"},{"location":"battle_companies/wars_aftermath/#against-the-odds-bonus","title":"'AGAINST THE ODDS' BONUS","text":"<p>Now that you have calculated your Battle Company's Rating, you will need to compare it to that of your opponents at the start of your next game.

The Easterlings have marched upon the kingdoms of Erebor and Dale, and Sauron has sent hordes of Orcs to assault the Elven realms within Mirkwood and Lothl\u00f3rien. This campaign is slightly unusual in that it is essentially three shorter campaigns in one. Sauron's plan was to have the Easterlings defeat the forces of D\u00e1in and Brand whilst a host of Orcs conquered Mirkwood. Then the two armies would converge on Lothl\u00f3rien, joining the army already there, to combine forces and defeat the Galadhrim.</p> <p>The Defence of the North campaign mirrors this as it starts with the war of the Easterlings against Erebor and Dale, then moves on to the battles in Mirkwood, before finishing with the skirmishes within Lothl\u00f3rien. Though these battles all happen at roughly the same time, we have decided to separate them out into the three shorter campaigns so that they can be played out individually. Also, the victor in each of these regions will gain bonuses for the battles happening elsewhere.</p> <p>You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though, if you wish, different players can take control of different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one plays...</p> <p>Another way that you can play this campaign, rather than to play it as one long series of battles, is to play each of the shorter campaigns individually and see which side can win the most; perhaps even having different players doing different parts of the campaign. If the Evil side wins the Battle of Dale, and then the Good side wins the Defence of Mirkwood, then it will be all to play for in the Assault on Lothl\u00f3rien!</p> <p>Whichever side wins the final battle in a campaign will be the overall winner of that campaign.</p> <p>SCENARIO BONUSES</p> <p>After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won that Scenario, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario.

However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order, as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one plays. </p> <p>SCENARIO BONUSES </p> <p>After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was the victor, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in The Battle for Pelargir Scenario, it will have an impact on the Docks of Harlond - a much later Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the future. </p>"},{"location":"campaigns/gondor_at_war/#1-defence-of-osgiliath","title":"(1) DEFENCE OF OSGILIATH","text":"<p>Good Victory: In the Retaking of Osgiliath Scenario, the range of the For Gondor!

This will connect together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the movies.</p> <p>As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the journey that Frodo Baggins embarked on with the Ring. The Scenarios start with Frodo's journey to get the Ring to Rivendell; beginning in the Shire and following Frodo's travels to Crickhollow, through the Old Forest and Bree, before his terrifying encounter with the Nazg\u00fbl at Weathertop and subsequent arrival at Rivendell. From there the campaign specifically follows the path of the Ringbearer; from Moria, to Amon Hen and then when Frodo and Sam separate from the Fellowship and go to Mordor alone. The Scenarios allow you to play through all aspects of Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring.</p> <p>You can play this campaign with as few as two people or, if you wish, different players can take control of the forces in different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one plays...</p> <p>LINKING YOUR GAMES</p> <p>Here we present rules on how to join your games together as you follow the journey to destroy the Ring. There are rules for what happens when members of the Fellowship are slain in battle, bonuses between Scenarios, and even how your Heroes regain their strength between games and recover their spent Might, Will, and Fate points \u2013 if they aren't too weary of course.</p> <p>SURVIVING THE JOURNEY</p> <p>There is a very real likelihood that some members of the Fellowship or their allies will perish along the journey; such dangerous adventures are not without risk, after all. It is important to record when Hero models spend Might, Will and Fate or suffer any Wounds as they will have the chance to regain them after the game. Whenever a Good Hero model is slain or removed as a casualty during a game, they may not actually be dead. Instead, you will need to roll on the Campaign Injury table below for them to see what effects their injuries have. Models slain may use any remaining Might to alter the result on the table.</p> D6 Result 1 Dead \u2013 This Hero has been slain in battle. If Frodo is ever slain, then the campaign comes to an end and Middle-earth falls into darkness. 2-3 Wounded \u2013 This Hero regains 1 Wound, but otherwise may not regain any other characteristics unless they are chosen as the Bravest Companion. 4+ Recovered \u2013 This Hero regains 1 Wound and then may recover as normal. <p>Additionally, if the Good player wins the Scenario, all their Hero models will gain a bonus of +1 to their rolls on the Campaign Injury table.</p> <p>RECOVERING STRENGTH</p> <p>As our Heroes battle their way through Middle-earth, they will become weary and tired beyond measure; their adventures taking their toll upon each member of the Fellowship, and often they will leave a battle exhausted and injured. To represent this, Good Hero models do not automatically regain any spent Might, Will, Fate or Wounds between games. Instead, they will regain a number of Might, Will, Fate and Wounds depending on how they performed in the previous game.</p> <p>To do this, follow the steps on this page, starting with the Bravest Companion, then Fellow Adventurer and finally Fool of a Took!</p> <p>Bravest Companion - After the game, both players should discuss which of the Good Hero models has performed above and beyond the call of duty. Perhaps they fended off many enemies, or sacrificed themselves for the good of the Ringbearer. This model may regain D6 Might, Will, Fate or Wounds of the controlling player's choice (this may be a mix of any) up to the value of the model's characteristics. If the Hero survived the previous battle, they may re-roll the D6 if they choose but the second result will stand even if it is worse than the first. </p> <p>It is important for both players to be honest when making the decision of which model is awarded the Bravest Companion as it makes for the campaign to be much more interesting.</p> <p>Fellow Adventurer - All other Hero models may regain D3 Might, Will, Fate or Wounds of the controlling player's choice (this may be a mix of any) up to the value of the model's characteristics. If the Hero survived the previous battle, they may re-roll the D3 if they choose but the second result will stand even if it is worse than the first. The only exception to this is if a model is chosen as\u2026</p> <p>Fool of a Took! - After the game, both players should discuss which of the Good Hero models, if any, has performed poorly in the previous game. This model gains no bonus whatsoever. This doesn't have to be awarded if both players agree that all the Good Hero models pulled their weight fairly. It is important for both players to be honest when making the decision as to which model is awarded the Fool of a Took! as it makes for the campaign to be much more interesting.</p> <p>REST POINTS</p> <p>At certain points in the campaign Frodo and his companions will have the chance to rest. When this is the case following a Scenario, all surviving Good Hero models will replenish their Might, Will, Fate and Wounds up to their starting values before the next game. These rest points will be clearly listed in the order of Scenarios and Scenario bonuses.</p> <p>SCENARIO BONUSES</p> <p>After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won that Scenario, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in the next Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in the Short Cuts Make Long Delays Scenario, the Good side will receive a bonus in the Buckleberry Ferry Scenario \u2013 the next Scenario in the campaign.

This is exactly what 'Fantasy Fellowship' is all about, allowing you to create your own Fellowship of the Ring and play out the various Scenarios throughout the War of the Ring to see if your own Fellowship could save Middle-earth.</p> <p>There are loads of 'what if' Scenarios that you could explore to change up your Fellowship before they embark on their long and arduous quest to Mount Doom. For instance, imagine if Denethor had sent Faramir to Rivendell instead of Boromir, or if Saruman had never been corrupted by the Palant\u00edr and aided the Ringbearer in his quest. What if Rohan had been present at the Council of Elrond and it was \u00c9omer or even Th\u00e9odred that journeyed instead of Boromir and Aragorn.</p> <p>You can even explore what would have happened if Bilbo had taken the Ring himself. Perhaps he would have been accompanied by one of the Dwarves of Thorin's Company, or maybe Heroes such as Bard the Bowman, Radagast the Brown, or even Beorn may have joined Bilbo in his quest to destroy The One Ring.</p> <p>This is the major concept behind Fantasy Fellowship. It allows you, the gamer, to form your own Fellowship using the rules presented here and see how far along the quest to Mount Doom they can get. You can also take the original Fellowship and see if they can survive longer than in the story.</p> <p>SELECTING YOUR FELLOWSHIP</p> <p>STEP 1: THE RINGBEARER</p> <p>Naturally, your Fellowship must have a Ringbearer to carry the Ring to Mount Doom. This can be any one of the four following profiles:</p> <ul> <li>Frodo Baggins (from The Fellowship army list)</li> <li>Bilbo Baggins (from the Thorin's Company army list)</li> <li>Bilbo Baggins (from The Shire army list)</li> <li>Sm\u00e9agol (from The Fellowship army list)</li> </ul> <p>If your chosen Ringbearer is Sm\u00e9agol then he gains The Ring. Additionally, he ignores his 'Serve the Master of the Precious' special rule.</p> <p>STEP 2: COMPANION</p> <p>The second most important member of your Fellowship, every Ringbearer will need a loyal friend to aid them on their journey. This is the character that will keep your Ringbearer on track, regardless of whatever hardships and perils lie in front of them. </p> <p>Your Ringbearer's Companion can be any Hobbit Hero that has not already been chosen as your Ringbearer, with the exception of the four Travellers: Frodo of the Nine Fingers; Samwise the Brave; Meriadoc, Captain of the Shire, and Peregrin, Captain of the Shire. </p> <p>If Bilbo Baggins from the Thorin's Company army list is chosen then his Companion may instead be any other member of Thorin's Company under 60 points if you wish.</p> <p>STEP 3: THE REST OF YOUR FELLOWSHIP</p> <p>With your Ringbearer and Companion now selected, it is time to choose the remaining members of your Fellowship to join them in their journey. Each chosen member will have to replace a certain character from the original Fellowship, and will replace that character in all the Scenarios that would have featured them along the way \u2013 so decide which of your chosen members replaces which original members wisely!</p> <p>Merry and Pippin may be replaced by any named Hero models in the game, however, neither may cost more than 50 points each, including any wargear purchased for them.</p> <p>Gandalf the Grey must be replaced by a Hero model from the following list, all of which can utilise a variety of different Magical Powers to their advantage: Gandalf the Grey; Saruman the White; Radagast the Brown; Galadriel; Elrond, Master of Rivendell; Celeborn; C\u00edrdan; Arwen Und\u00f3miel; Gildor Inglorion; Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm.</p> <p>If Saruman the White is selected as your Wizard then you may select Gr\u00edma Wormtongue as a member of your Fellowship. The remaining members of your Fellowship (Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir) can be replaced by any other named Hero models you choose. Remember that whoever you choose to replace certain characters will take on their role. So, if you choose Prince Imrahil as your replacement for Aragorn, it will be Prince Imrahil that fights at Helm's Deep. It is also important to remember that Boromir is doomed to die, so whoever you choose to replace Boromir will also be doomed to die! </p> <p>There are a few additional rules to take into account when selecting your Fantasy Fellowship, which are detailed below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Naturally, all of your Hero models must be from the Good side \u2013 no Evil models here!</p> </li> <li> <p>The total cost of your Fellowship may not exceed 750 points \u2013 so choose carefully!</p> </li> <li> <p>If you choose another character who can take The Ring, they do not get it in this campaign \u2013 you have already selected your Ringbearer after all!</p> </li> <li> <p>Models may purchase additional wargear from their profile. </p> </li> <li> <p>Heroes that are bought as a pair, such as Elladan &amp; Elrohir or M\u00farin &amp; Dr\u00e1r, will take up two slots in your Fellowship.</p> </li> <li> <p>All models must have the Infantry Keyword, as such no models can be purchased a mount of any kind.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Rule of One applies here, so multiples of the same named Hero or wargear cannot be taken.</p> </li> <li> <p>Whilst players are free to select their own members, we find that Fantasy Fellowship works better, and feels more thematic, if the selected members all co-existed and were alive at the same time.</p> </li> <li> <p>The following models cannot be included in your Fellowship under any circumstances: Tom Bombadil; Goldberry; Gandalf the White; Galadriel, Lady of Light.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Below is an example of a Fantasy Fellowship. You will notice that Bilbo hasn't been given Sting or the Mithril Coat; this is because he will receive them when he reaches Rivendell and it is better to save precious points rather than spend them now.</p> <p></p> <p>CAMPAIGN</p> <p>Whilst it will be tempting to select additional wargear for the members of your Fellowship, one of the most rewarding parts of playing through Fantasy Fellowship*is seeing how your heroes develop and grow. In this campaign, when your Fellowship reaches certain points, they will receive wargear or upgrades that correspond to the actual items received in the books or films.</p> <p>For example, when Frodo reaches Rivendell he is gifted Sting and the Mithril Coat; and when the Fellowship reach Lothl\u00f3rien they are given Elven Cloaks.</p> <p>You should keep this in mind when selecting your Fellowship; you don't want to spend precious points on wargear that you may end up getting for free during the campaign!</p> <p>THE CAMPAIGN</p> <p>The Fantasy Fellowship campaign consists of a total of 23 different Scenarios following the journey of the Fellowship from the Shire all the way to the fires of Mount Doom. You should play these Scenarios in the order given to faithfully recreate the epic adventure that the Fellowship of the Ring undertook. Each Scenario will also list the original members of the Fellowship that would normally take part in that Scenario; all you need to do is swap them for the relevant Heroes from your own Fantasy Fellowship. It will also tell you where to find the Scenario in question; some can be found in this supplement, whilst others appear in other publications.</p> <p>Additionally, there are some extra rules for linking your games together, such as if members of your Fellowship fall along the way, or how much of their strength they recover between games.</p> <p>SURVIVING THE JOURNEY</p> <p>There is a very real likelihood that some members of your Fellowship will perish on the journey; such dangerous adventures are not without risk, after all. It is important to record when Hero models spend Might, Will, and Fate, or suffer any Wounds, as they will have the chance to regain them after the game. Whenever a member of your Fellowship is slain or removed as a casualty during a game, they may not actually be dead. Instead, you will need to roll on the Campaign Injury Table below to see what effects their injuries have. Models slain may use any remaining Might to alter the result on the table.</p> D6 Result 1 Dead \u2013 This Hero has been slain in battle. If your Ringbearer is ever slain, then the campaign comes to an end and Middle-earth falls into darkness. 2-3 Wounded \u2013 This Hero regains 1 Wound, but otherwise may not regain any other characteristics unless they are chosen as the Bravest Companion. 4+ Recovered \u2013 This Hero regains 1 Wound and then may recover as normal. <p>Additionally, if the Good player wins the Scenario, all their Hero models will gain a bonus of +1 to their rolls on the Campaign Injury Table.</p> <p>RECOVERING STRENGTH</p> <p>As your Fellowship battles its way through Middle-earth, they will become weary and tired beyond measure; their adventures taking their toll upon each member of your Fellowship, and often they will leave a battle exhausted and injured. To represent this, members of your Fellowship do not automatically regain any spent Might, Will, Fate, or Wounds between games. Instead, they will regain a number of Might, Will, Fate, and Wounds depending on how they performed in the previous game.</p> <p>Bravest Companion - After the game, both players should discuss which member of your Fellowship has performed above and beyond the call of duty. Perhaps they fended off many enemies or sacrificed themselves for the good of the Ringbearer. This model may regain D6 Might, Will, Fate, or Wounds of the controlling player's choice (this may be a mix of any) up to the value of the model's characteristics. If the Hero survived the previous battle, they may re-roll the D6 if they choose, but the second result will stand even if it is worse than the first. It is important for both players to be honest when making the decision of which model is awarded the Bravest Companion as it makes the campaign much more interesting.</p> <p>Fellow Adventurer - All other members of your Fellowship may regain D3 Might, Will, Fate, or Wounds of the controlling player's choice (this may be a mix of any) up to the value of the model's characteristics. If the Hero survived the previous battle, they may re-roll the D3 if they choose, but the second result will stand even if it is worse than the first. The only exception to this is if a model is chosen as...</p> <p>Fool of a Took! - After the game, both players should discuss which member of your Fellowship, if any, has performed poorly in the previous game. This model gains no bonus whatsoever. This doesn't have to be awarded if both players agree that all members of your Fellowship pulled their weight fairly. It is important for both players to be honest when making the decision as to which model is awarded the Fool of a Took! as it makes the campaign much more interesting.</p> <p>REST POINTS</p> <p>At certain points in the campaign, your Fellowship will have the chance to rest. When this is the case following a Scenario, all surviving members will replenish their Might, Will, Fate, and Wounds up to their starting values before the next game. These will be clearly listed in the order of Scenarios. Some rest points may only apply to certain Hero models; where this is the case, it will be clearly stated.</p> <p>SCENARIOS</p> <p>Here we present the Scenarios that should be played as part of a Fantasy Fellowship campaign, along with the Heroes that would normally play that Scenario for you to replace with members of your own Fellowship, and where you can find that Scenario. If you wish, you can add more Scenarios to this list if you want to play through every single aspect of the story. </p> <p>If a Scenario lists a Hero in its Participants that you have in your Fellowship, other than the ones that are replaced by your Fantasy Fellowship then replace that model with a suitable Captain to represent them in that Scenario.</p> <p>For example, if you have chosen \u00c9omer as part of your Fantasy Fellowship, then in the \u00c9omer's Return Scenario he will be replaced by a Captain of Rohan with appropriate wargear. Similarly, if you have selected Faramir as part of your Fantasy Fellowship then in the Osgiliath Scenario he will be replaced by a Captain of Minas Tirith with appropriate wargear.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/quest_of_the_ringbearer/#1-buckleberry-ferry","title":"(1) BUCKLEBERRY FERRY","text":"<p>Fellowship Members: Frodo Baggins;

However, Gandalf is reborn as Gandalf the White for the \u00c9omer's Return Scenario, and will be restored to his starting values of Might, Will, Fate and Wounds.  </p> <p>If you replaced Gandalf then whoever represents him in your Fellowship will fall at The Bridge of Khazad-d\u00fbm and come back for \u00c9omer's Return in the same manner.

Frodo cannot use this if he is wearing the Ring.</p> <p>Sam \u2013 Elven Rope <code>ACTIVE</code> \u2013 The bearer always counts as rolling a 6 for any Climb, Jump or Leap tests that he has to make.</p> <p>Merry &amp; Pippin \u2013 Daggers of the Noldorin <code>ACTIVE</code> \u2013 The bearer may re-roll any failed To Wound rolls in combat.</p> <p>Aragorn \u2013 Elven Dagger <code>ACTIVE</code> \u2013 This is an Elven-made dagger with the Uruk-haibane special rule.</p> <p>Legolas \u2013 Bow of the Galadhrim <code>ACTIVE</code> \u2013 Whilst within 3\" of a friendly model, the bearer may re-roll any failed To Hit rolls when shooting.</p> <p>Gimli \u2013 Galadriel's Locks <code>ACTIVE</code> \u2013 Gimli may re-roll all dice in a Duel roll. Gimli may only use this ability three times per game.</p> <p>Boromir \u2013 Golden Belt <code>ACTIVE</code> \u2013 The bearer gains the Woodland Creature special rule.</p> <p>HELM'S DEEP</p> <p>For The Battle of Helm's Deep Scenario, the Three Hunters don armour to help protect them against the Uruk-hai. The Hero models representing Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli all gain armour if they don't already have some form of armour.</p> <p>MERRY AND PIPPIN</p> <p>For the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Hobbits wear armour when they go to war. From Scenario 18 onwards, the Hero models representing Merry and Pippin gain armour for all Scenarios if they don't already wear some form of armour.</p> <p>CIRITH UNGOL</p> <p>By the time he has awoken in Cirith Ungol, Frodo no longer has Sting or the Mithril Coat. From the Tower of Cirith Ungol Scenario onwards, Frodo no longer wears the Mithril Coat or carries the Phial of Galadriel. Additionally, Sam now bears Sting.</p> <p>THE BLACK GATE</p> <p>Before setting out for the Black Gate, Aragorn dons the armour and robes of the King of Gondor.

This will join together the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios in such a way that it will feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the stories of Middle-earth.</p> <p>As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the battles and events that happened during the founding of Angmar and the Witch-king's subsequent rise to power, at the expense of the waning kingdom of Arnor. The scenarios start some years following the splintering of Arnor into three smaller realms - Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur - and will begin with the forces of Angmar growing and conquering Rhudaur. From there you will be able to play through many of the well-known (and some lesser-known) events during the fall of Arnor; from the ruin of Amon Sul, to Arvedui's last defence of his kingdom, through to the epic Battle of Fornost that heralded the defeat of Angmar. There are also some Scenarios that focus on what happened in the years following the Witch-king's defeat at Fornost, as well as further Scenarios in the appendix that follow the lineage of Isildur at the close of the Third Age.</p> <p>You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though, if you wish, different players can take control of different Scenarios - that way you can get a whole gaming group involved.

This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in the Assault on Rivendell Scenario, then the Good side will receive a bonus in the An Unlikely Ally Scenario - a much later Scenario in the campaign.

This will make the already dynamic Narrative Play Scenarios feel as if you are playing through the scenes directly from the books and the movies.</p> <p>As you may have already guessed, this supplement focuses on the skirmishes and events that happened within the Shire from when Sharkey began to take over to the return of the Travellers. The Scenarios start with the amassing of the Ruffians in Bree, and the very beginning of Sharkey's regime under the influence of his puppet, Lotho Sackville-Baggins, through to the various arrests of well-meaning Hobbits and the birth of a small rebellion, to the final Battle of Bywater - the most famous battle in the history of the Shire.</p> <p>You can play this campaign with as few as two people, though if you wish, different players can take control of different Scenarios, that way you can get a whole gaming group involved. However, it is important to note that you should play the Scenarios in order, as the results of one Scenario may change how a later one plays...</p> <p>SCENARIO BONUSES</p> <p>After each Scenario has been completed, it is important to note down which side won, either Good or Evil. This is important as, depending on who was victorious, there may be a bonus or penalty to a certain side in a future Scenario. For example, if the Good side is victorious in the Maggot's Farm Scenario, the Good side will receive a bonus in the Battle of Bywater Scenario - a much later Scenario in the campaign. These bonuses reflect the advantages of success and the edge it will give either side in the future.</p> <p>THE LOCKHOLES</p> <p>As an added feature to make this campaign really mirror the cruel regime that Sharkey has imposed across the Shire, you may choose to use this optional rule for your campaign. Should any Hobbit Hero model be captured or removed as a casualty, it is safe to assume that they have been dragged off to the Lockholes following the battle should the Evil side win (with the exceptions of Holfoot Bracegirdle and Robin Smallburrow, who are instead bullied into following the orders of the Ruffians). Make a note of which Hobbit Hero models have been sent to the Lockholes across the campaign. Any that have been captured may not appear in any future Scenario unless they have escaped. This does not apply to any of the Scenarios that happen after the Lockholes Scenario.</p> <p>In The Lockholes Scenario, replace the Hobbit Militia that have been arrested with any Hobbit Hero models that have been captured - this is your one chance to rescue any Hobbits that have been taken prisoner! Any Hobbit Hero models rescued in this way may then join in the Battle of Bywater Scenario.

The special rules of either the Scenario or character will state how many of each type of Trap the Hobbit player may deploy at the start of the game. Traps are deployed after both sides have set up but before the first turn begins. Friendly models treat Traps as open ground but no model may finish their movement with their base overlapping a Trap marker.</p> <p>Traps can be deployed anywhere on the board, although they must be deployed using the following rules:</p> <ul> <li>Traps may not be deployed within the enemy player's deployment zone.</li> <li>Traps may not be deployed within 3\" of another Trap.</li> <li>Traps may not be deployed within an enemy model's Control Zone.</li> <li>Traps may not be deployed within 2\" of an Objective marker in Scenarios where this applies.</li> </ul> <p>TRIGGERING TRAPS</p> <p>When Trap markers are deployed, they are always placed face-down so that the opposing player cannot tell what kind of Trap each Trap marker represents. When an enemy model moves within 1\" of a Trap marker, they immediately stop moving \u2013 flip the Trap marker over and resolve the effects of the Trap that is revealed, as explained opposite. Models that reveal a Trap marker cannot continue moving after revealing the Trap; they have either fallen into the Trap or used the rest of their movement to avoid it.</p> <ul> <li>TRIPWIRE TRAP</li> </ul> <p>When a Tripwire Trap is revealed, the Hobbit player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the Trap suffers a Strength 2 hit and is placed Prone. Cavalry models that reveal a Tripwire Trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also count as being Knocked Flying in addition to suffering a Strength 2 hit. Monster models are unaffected by a Tripwire Trap, and can continue to move even after revealing the Trap. After the effects are resolved, remove the Trap from play.</p> <ul> <li>SNARE TRAP</li> </ul> <p>When a Snare Trap is revealed, the Hobbit player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the Trap is immediately knocked Prone and suffers a Strength 1 hit (they actually either have their legs tied up or are kept dangling in the air, but this has the same effect). A model that is caught in a Snare Trap cannot move until they have freed themselves. They will not stand up if they win a fight and will always count as being Trapped. During the End phase of each turn, roll a D6 for a model caught in a Snare Trap. If the result is equal to or less than the model's Strength characteristic then the model has freed themselves and may immediately stand up.</p> <p>Cavalry models that reveal a Snare Trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also count as being Knocked Flying in addition to suffering a Strength 1 hit. Monster models are unaffected by a Snare Trap, and can continue to move even after revealing the Trap. After the effects are resolved, remove the Trap from play.</p> <ul> <li>PITFALL TRAP</li> </ul> <p>When a Pitfall Trap is revealed, the Hobbit player rolls a D6. On a 2+, the model that revealed the Trap immediately falls into the hole. A model that falls into a Pitfall Trap may attempt to get out of the hole at the start of each of its Move phases. Roll a D6. On a 4+, the model clambers out of the hole at the cost of half of its Move value.</p> <p>Whilst in a Pitfall Trap, a model always counts as being Trapped. Cavalry models that reveal a Pitfall Trap are only affected on a 4+. However, they will also count as being Knocked Flying in addition to falling into the hole. Monster models are unaffected by a Pitfall Trap, and can continue to move even after revealing the Trap. After the effects are resolved, leave the Pitfall Trap face-up. A model can attempt to cross a Pitfall Trap by passing a Jump test, but if they fail, they will fall into the hole. If a model is forced into base contact with the Pitfall Trap (such as when they Back Away) then they will fall into the hole. Only one model at a time can be in a Pitfall Trap.</p> <ul> <li>DUMMY TRAP</li> </ul> <p>When an Infantry model reveals a Dummy Trap, remove the Trap from play (there is no Trap there after all!), though the model will still stop moving. Cavalry and War Beast models are unaffected by a Dummy Trap, and can continue to move even after revealing the Trap.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/war_in_rohan/","title":"War in Rohan","text":""},{"location":"campaigns/war_in_rohan/#war-in-rohan-campaign","title":"WAR IN ROHAN CAMPAIGN","text":"<p>Here we present you with the War in Rohan campaign, a system of linking your games together in such a way that the results of one game can impact your next game or even one much later on!

Additionally, a Khandish Chariot is an unusual model and moves in the following way:</p> <p>\u2022   At the start of its Move phase, the controlling player may pivot the Chariot up to 45\u00b0. When pivoting, the Chariot may touch models or terrain. In the case of models, move them out of the way by the shortest route possible. In the case of terrain, move the Chariot away just enough to complete its pivot.</p> <p>\u2022   The Chariot may then move up to 10\" in a straight line. After each full 3\" the Chariot has moved, it may pivot a further 45\u00b0.</p> <p>\u2022   Once the Chariot has pivoted to face its desired direction, move it forwards the desired amount in a straight line, ignoring enemy models' Control Zones. Any models the Chariot comes into contact with whilst moving (not pivoting) will suffer two Strength 4 hits. If the model is slain, the Chariot may continue with its movement. Cavalry models suffer two hits on both the rider and the mount. If the rider survives but the mount is slain, the rider is thrown and, after testing on the Thrown Rider chart, is placed in base contact with the Chariot. Might may not be used to affect the result of these hits. A Chariot that is affected by a Heroic March may still inflict these hits as normal.</p> <p>\u2022   If the model the Chariot charged survives, the Chariot will still gain the benefits of its Monstrous Charge special rule.</p> <p>\u2022   The Chariot may instead choose to forego its movement in order to pivot to face any direction. If a Chariot is moved by an enemy model, it may not pivot in this way.</p> <p>\u2022   A Khandish Chariot cannot jump obstacles that form a physical barrier, such as hedges, walls, fences or rocks. They may attempt to cross obstacles such as streams or gullies if they wish, but if a 1 is rolled, the rider is automatically thrown and the Chariot is destroyed. </p>"},{"location":"forces_of_good/","title":"Forces of Good","text":""},{"location":"forces_of_good/#good-armies-alliance-matrix","title":"GOOD ARMIES ALLIANCE MATRIX","text":"<p>ARMY KEY</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"forces_of_good/army_of_lake_town/","title":"Army of Lake-town","text":""},{"location":"forces_of_good/army_of_lake_town/#army-composition","title":"ARMY COMPOSITION","text":"<p>This army may include: Bard the Bowman; The Master of Laketown; Alfrid the Councilor; Braga, Captain of the Guard; Bain, Son of Bard; Sigrid &amp; Tilda; Lake-town Guard Captains and Lake-town Guard.</p>"},{"location":"forces_of_good/army_of_lake_town/#army-bonus","title":"ARMY BONUS","text":"<p>The Master's Purse-strings \u2013 The Master of Lake-town's Moneybags special rule has a range of 12\" rather than 6\".</p>"},{"location":"forces_of_good/army_of_lake_town/#heroes-of-the-army-of-lake-town","title":"HEROES OF THE ARMY OF LAKE-TOWN","text":""},{"location":"forces_of_good/army_of_lake_town/#master-of-lake-town-50-points","title":"MASTER OF LAKE-TOWN [50 POINTS]","text":"<p>MAN, LAKE-TOWN, INFANTRY, HERO \u2014 HERO OF VALOUR</p> Mv F S D A W C M W F 6\" 4/4+ 4 4 2 2 3 2 2 2 <p>WARGEAR</p> <ul> <li>Unarmed</li> </ul> <p>HEROIC ACTIONS</p> <ul> <li>Heroic Defence</li> </ul> <p>SPECIAL RULES</p> <ul> <li>Moneybags <code>ACTIVE</code></li> </ul> <p>The Master of Lake-town can choose to expend a single point of Might at the start of the Fight phase.

This is a crossbow that fires D6 shots per turn. The bolt thrower only has a limited field of fire of 45\u02da to its left or right. The Chariot may still fire even if it has moved its full distance that turn. Additionally, the Chariot does not suffer the -1 penalty for moving and shooting.</p> <p>The Chariot may still shoot even if Engaged in combat and does not need an In The Way test for models Engaged with it. Each shot may target a different enemy. If it does this, then the Dwarf operating the rapid fire bolt thrower may not add its Attacks or Fight value to the Duel roll, and may not make Strikes, in the following Fight phase.</p> <ul> <li>Chariot Charge <code>ACTIVE</code></li> </ul> <p>The Iron Hills Chariot is an unusual model and moves in the following way:</p> <p>\u2022 At the start of the Move phase, the controlling player may pivot the Chariot up to 45\u00ba. When pivoting, the Chariot may touch models or terrain. In the case of models, move them out of the way by the shortest route possible. In the case of terrain, move the Chariot away just enough to complete its pivot.</p> <p>\u2022 The Chariot may then move up to 4\" in a straight line.</p> <p>\u2022 If it has moved a full 4\", it may pivot a further 45\u00ba.</p> <p>\u2022 The Chariot may then move up to a further 4\" in a straight line.</p> <p>\u2022 When the Chariot moves, it ignores enemy models' Control Zones. Any models the Chariot comes into contact with whilst moving (not pivoting) will suffer three Strength 6 hits. If the model is slain then the Chariot may continue with its movement. Cavalry models suffer three hits on both the rider and the mount. If the rider survives but the mount is slain, the rider is thrown and, after testing on the Thrown Rider chart, is placed in base contact with the Chariot. Might may not be used to affect the result of these hits. A Chariot that is affected by a Heroic March may still inflict these hits as normal.</p> <p>\u2022 If the model the Chariot Charged survives, the Chariot will still gain the benefits of its Monstrous Charge special rule.</p> <p>\u2022 The Chariot may instead choose to forego its movement in order to pivot to face any direction. If a Chariot is moved by an enemy model, it may not pivot in this way.</p> <ul> <li>The Chariot in Combat <code>ACTIVE</code></li> </ul> <p>The Chariot counts as one model in a fight. Any surviving crew member that is not driving the Chariot adds their Attacks to the Duel roll. Additionally, the Chariot will also use the highest Fight value of any Dwarf that is on the Chariot (including the driver). No model that is riding on an Iron Hills Chariot can declare a Heroic Combat.</p> <p>If beaten, any model wishing to Strike the crew must roll to see if they hit the crew or the Chariot. To do this, roll a D6 for each Strike. On a 4+, the Strike hits the crew member of the attacker's choice \u2013 anything else hits the Chariot.</p> <p>If the Chariot loses the Fight, it does not Back Away. It also never counts as Trapped. If the Chariot is slain, then the crew inside are lost \u2013 remove the model as a casualty.</p> <ul> <li>Large War Machine <code>ACTIVE</code></li> </ul> <p>On a turn in which the Iron Hills Chariot Charges, it gains the Extra Attack and Knock to the Ground bonuses as if it was a Cavalry model. The Iron Hills Chariot still gets these bonuses even if it charges a Cavalry model. When the Chariot is hit by a shooting attack, the shooter must take an In The Way test to determine if the Chariot or the crew are hit. On a 1-4, the Chariot has been hit and on a 5-6, it hits the Dwarf closest to the shooter. The Chariot may not make Jump, Climb, Leap or Swim tests, and may not lie down or defend barriers. It may not enter difficult terrain other than shallow water features (including swamps, rivers, etc.), which it is completely unimpeded by. The Chariot cannot be Barged, Hurled or knocked Prone for any reason.</p> <ul> <li>The Chariot and Magic <code>ACTIVE</code></li> </ul> <p>Models with Magical Powers can use them on the Chariot, selecting either the Chariot itself or one of the crew members as the target. Magical Powers that affect multiple targets will automatically affect both the Chariot and its crew, if in range of the model. Only by affecting the Driver will a Magical Power such as Transfix or Compel impede the Chariot's movement (thereby causing it to remain stationary or take a move as described by the Magical Power). Finally, Magical Powers such as Sorcerous Blast, Nature's Wrath and Call Winds will not move the Chariot or knock it Prone, although they will still inflict any damage as detailed in the Magical Power's description.</p> <ul> <li>Iron Hills Captain <code>ACTIVE</code></li> </ul> <p>If this upgrade is taken for the Chariot, then an Iron Hills Captain will replace the driver. The Iron Hills Captain will have all of the usual wargear and special rules that an Iron Hills Captain would normally possess whilst riding the Chariot (see page 29).

If the Champions of Erebor are taken, replace the Warrior keyword with Hero.</p> <p>The Chariot is also subject to the following exceptions:</p> <p>\u2022 Balin must always be the driver. Should Balin the Dwarf, Champion of Erebor be slain, another Dwarf on the Chariot immediately takes his place. Should all the Dwarves be slain, then the Chariot is removed as a casualty. If the Chariot is slain, the Dwarves take a Thrown Rider test instead.</p> <p>\u2022 The Dwarves who ride the Chariot have all of their usual wargear and special rules (see pages 38-39) whilst riding in the Chariot.</p> <p>\u2022 Dwalin must always man the rapid fire bolt thrower until he is slain.</p> <p>\u2022 Unlike other Iron Hills Chariots, only Balin, Dwalin, Kili and Fili may ride this Chariot.</p> <p>\u2022 Magical Powers may be directed at the Dwarves individually, in which case they will Resist and be affected individually with no impact on each other.</p> <p>\u2022 In combat, the Chariot is very unusual in that a Duel can effectively have multiple models on both sides of the Fight. When making a Duel roll, make sure to roll each Dwarf's attacks separately for the purpose of using Might points. Additionally, each Dwarf may decide to use Special Strikes. If Kili or Fili use the Feint Special Strike, then the Fight values of all of the crew and the Chariot itself will be reduced by D3. If Kili or Fili use the Stab Special Strike, then only they will be affected. If Dwalin uses the Piercing Strike Special Strike then only his Strength and Defence will be affected.</p> <p>\u2022 This version of the Chariot counts as four models for the purpose of working out Break points.</p> <p>\u2022 The Chariot counts as a Hero for the Erebor Reclaimed army list and may be the army leader.

Each represents those fighting forces that were present at a specific battle or point in time within the history of Middle-earth, either from the books or the movies. They provide a bespoke army list with all of the relevant Heroes as well as a series of special rules to faithfully encapsulate the feel of the moment you are representing on the tabletop.</p> <p>HOW DO THEY WORK?</p> <p>A Legendary Legion is a standalone army list that is separate from all of the others presented elsewhere. It will list all of the profiles that can be used when fielding it, as well as any wargear that can be taken by the units and Heroes included. This may mean that a profile that could normally take a certain piece of wargear may not be able to take that piece of wargear in a Legendary Legion if it does not fit the specific theme of the list. Alternatively, some profiles may come with certain wargear already built into their points cost, ensuring that the relevant wargear is always taken. When this is the case, the wargear will be stated in the profile's entry and its points value will have been adjusted accordingly.</p> <p>A Legendary Legion will often be made up of profiles that would normally not be in the same army list. This is intentional as it allows players to create a force that is thematic and fits the specific snapshot or moment from the books or movies that the Legendary Legion represents. </p> <p>When a Legendary Legion lists a profile that can be used in the army list, the profile can be found either in this supplement or in Armies of The Lord of the Rings or Armies of The Hobbit\u2122. Additionally, Hero models will keep the same Heroic Tier that they are presented with in their specific profile, unless otherwise stated. </p> <p>All Legendary Legions will have a series of special rules that will help set them apart from the other army lists available. Each special rule will help to enhance the character of the army and really add to the feel that you are playing with the force directly out of the books or movies. </p> <p>Additionally, Legendary Legions will often have a list of restrictions that players must abide by in order to use that army list. This could be anything from making sure that all models are mounted, or having a certain Hero lead the army \u2013 anything that gives the army a better feel for the scene it is representing. </p> <p>As Legendary Legions are meant to represent a specific point in time, there are a few differences between them and the normal army lists found in Armies of The Lord of the Rings and Armies of The Hobbit.</p> <p>1) THEY CANNOT ALLY</p> <p>Legendary Legions focus on key moments from the books and movies, and as such they will already contain all of the relevant profiles that can be used within the army list. Because of this, they cannot ally with any other army lists under any circumstances.</p> <p>2) THEY DON'T HAVE AN ARMY BONUS</p> <p>Whilst other army lists have an Army Bonus to reward players for taking a pure force, Legendary Legions go one step further. Whilst they don't have an Army Bonus as such (mainly because they must always be pure forces by their very nature), they will have a series of additional special rules instead, all of which are listed on the relevant Legendary Legion's page. </p> <p>3) HERO MODELS CAN LEAD WARRIOR MODELS THEY COULD NOT NORMALLY LEAD</p> <p>Often, a Legendary Legion will encompass various profiles from multiple different army lists. When building your force using a Legendary Legion, Hero models from the list may lead any of the Warrior models from the same list \u2013 even if they would not normally be able to do so. This allows players to fully build an army that mirrors the scene that the Legendary Legion is trying to replicate. </p>"},{"location":"legendary_legions/arathorns_stand/","title":"Arathorn's Stand","text":""},{"location":"legendary_legions/arathorns_stand/#army-composition","title":"ARMY COMPOSITION","text":"<p>ARATHORN [75 points]</p> <p>HALBARAD [70 points]</p> <p>\u2022 Horse: 10 points  </p> <p>RANGER OF THE NORTH [30 points]</p> <p>\u2022 Horse: 10 points \u2022 Spear: 1 point  </p> <p>D\u00daNEDAIN [25 points]</p> <p>\u2022 Spear: 1 point  </p>"},{"location":"legendary_legions/arathorns_stand/#additional-rules","title":"ADDITIONAL RULES","text":"<ul> <li>An Arathorn's Stand force must always include Arathorn, who is always the army's leader.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"legendary_legions/arathorns_stand/#special-rules","title":"SPECIAL RULES","text":"<p>\"They're dangerous folk, wandering the wilds\" \u2013 Rangers of the North and D\u00fanedain from this Legendary Legion may benefit from the Stand Fast! of Arathorn or Halbarad.

At the start of the game, each player should select three of the Secret Objectives to put forward without making them known to their opponent.

Throughout a game, you'll often find yourself referring to these to see which model wins a Duel, or whether a weapon's blow wounds a victim, etc.</p> <p>Mv (Move) \u2014 This characteristic is probably used the most in the game \u2014 it tells you how far in inches (\") that model may move in each of its Move phases.</p> <p>F (Fight) \u2014 Fight is the characteristic that denotes a model's skill at fighting a Duel and firing a shooting weapon. This characteristic comprises two numbers divided by a slash. The first number is called the Fight value and shows how skilful the model is in a Duel; the better they are, the higher the Fight value. The second number is called the Shoot value and is always followed by the + sign; this shows the model's skill with missile weapons. The number indicates what score needs to be rolled in order for the model to hit its intended target; so in this instance, the lower it is, the better.</p> <p>S (Strength) \u2014 This characteristic shows how strong the model is. A mighty Troll will have a much higher Strength than a lowly Hobbit, for example. The higher a model's Strength, the more easily it will injure an opponent.</p> <p>D (Defence) \u2014 Defence represents how hard it is to hurt a model. If a model is clad in thick armour, or is inherently tough and resilient, its Defence will be higher, and the higher it is, the harder the model is to wound in battle.</p> <p>A (Attacks) \u2014 The Attacks characteristic represents how many blows a model can land upon an enemy during a Duel. It literally translates to the number of dice that a model will roll during the Fight phase, both for making the initial Duel roll, and for making Strikes against an enemy.</p> <p>W (Wounds) \u2014 This denotes how many injuries a model can sustain before it will succumb to its wounds and be slain. If at any point during the game a model's Wounds are reduced to 0, they are immediately removed from the board as a casualty. Most fighters will have just a single Wound, so will be removed as soon as they are wounded. Some creatures and characters are possessed with an exceptional resolve or massive bulk and can suffer two, three or even more Wounds before they are slain.</p> <p>C (Courage) \u2014 How brave and determined a model is is measured by their Courage characteristic. The lower this value, the more likely the model is to quail in fear from a terrifying foe or flee the battlefield when the going gets tough.</p> <p>M, W, F (Might, Will, Fate) \u2014 Some models, known as Hero models, possess an additional three characteristics known as Might, Will and Fate. Unlike the other characteristics, these are represented by a store of points that can be spent during the game.</p> <p>A Hero can use these points to perform special actions throughout the course of the game, avoid harm or any number of other heroic feats.

Depending on what sized game you decide to play, you may have to set aside more time for it to ensure that it will reach its natural conclusion.</p> <p>A Skirmish is usually in the region of about 400 points per side, this will usually allow each player to have one or two warbands each with a couple of low-ranking Hero models, or a single warband that is being led by one really major character. A small game will usually take no longer than an hour, sometimes even shorter, to finish \u2014 perfect for a quick lunchtime clash or if you are tight on time.</p> <p>A Battle will typically be around the 600-1,000 point mark, but this will often vary depending upon the amount of time available. A Battle will allow players to field an average of three or four warbands, although some armies may get more or less depending on what they put in their force. A Battle also allows you to field some of your much bigger models that you may not be able to field at Skirmish level. Battles will usually take somewhere between one and a half to two and a half hours to play, making them ideal for tournaments, gaming weekends or just a casual afternoon with some friends.</p> <p>All-out War games are the biggest scale games that you can play, starting around the 1,250 point mark and going upwards from there, making for a truly epic confrontation. An All-out War will allow most players to achieve at least six warbands each, even if they take lots of big monsters and legendary heroes along with them, allowing for players to field a mighty army with everything they will want to field! An All-out War game can take a long time \u2014 many will last for the whole day and for the biggest, maybe even an entire weekend.

Instead, we will present a brand new way to play this Scenario that is tactical, fast-paced and, most importantly, a lot of fun!</p> <p>STATS</p> <p>Action Points (AP) - These are used by the models to complete the following actions: moving, shooting, or fighting in combat.</p> <p>Shoot (S) - How good a model is at using their bow, or other ranged weaponry. This shows the score on a D6 that a model needs to hit - so the lower, the better!</p> <p>Combat (C) - The number of D6s a model will roll when fighting in combat.</p> <p>Wounds (W) - The number of Wounds the model can suffer before being slain. Should a model's Wounds ever be reduced to 0, they will be slain - remove the model from the Howdah.</p> <p>GAME ROUND</p> <p>At the start of each turn, each model is allocated the number of APs that is stated in their statline - this is all that they will get for that turn. Starting with the Good player, both players take turns activating a model that has APs remaining (a model that has no APs cannot be selected) until both players have used up all of the APs their side has been allocated.</p> <p>During a model's activation, it may spend any number of APs available to that model to make any of the Basic Actions that follow. </p> <p>A model that is activated must spend at least one AP during its activation, but does not have to spend all of its APs if it has more than one - this may mean that a model can activate multiple times over the course of a turn.</p> <p>Once both players have spent all of their APs, the turn ends and a new one begins.

For each AP spent in this way, the model may move 1\" or move up or down a level in the Howdah. When moving up or down a level, simply place the model in the nearest space available in the level they wish to move to, as close to where they started their move as possible.</p> <p>Shooting: Cost - 1 AP  </p> <p>Any model armed with a ranged weapon may fire it at an enemy model that it can see. For each AP spent, the model declares which ranged weapon they are using and rolls a D6. If the result of this roll is equal to or greater than the model's Shoot value, then a hit is scored. For each hit that is scored, you will need to roll To Wound. Each ranged weapon will state what D6 score is required to cause a Wound, and for each roll of a D6 that matches or exceeds this roll, the target suffers a Wound. A model may shoot at a target that is on the same level or the one below without penalty. However, if a model shoots at a target that is on a higher level and causes a Wound, the Wound will be ignored on a D6 roll of a 4+.</p> <p>Fighting: Cost - 1 AP  </p> <p>Any model may fight an enemy that is within 1\" and on the same level of the Howdah. For each AP spent, the model declares which combat weapon they are using and rolls a number of D6 equal to their Combat value.

If you are going to play this game, we suggest gathering a group of friends, plenty of tea and seed cake, and taking the whole weekend to play out the most important battle of the Third Age!</p> <p>LAYOUT</p> <p>This Scenario is played on an 8'x6' board. Along the northern board edge are the walls of Minas Tirith, in the center of which is the Gatehouse. The rest of the battlefield is barren, very befitting of the fields of Pelennor and providing plenty of space for the huge number of models that take part in this battle.</p> <p>STARTING POSITIONS</p> <p>The Evil player deploys the Mordor force (except the Witch-king of Angmar) anywhere between 24\" and 48\" from the northern board edge and at least 24\" from both the eastern and western board edges (see map). They then deploy the Easterling and Khand force anywhere between 12\" and 24\" of the southern board edge and at least 24\" from both the eastern and western board edges (see map). The Good player then deploys the Grey Company force anywhere within 6\" of the western board edge and at least 24\" from both the northern and southern board edges (see map). They then deploy the Rohan force anywhere within 6\" of the eastern board edge. The Witch-king of Angmar, Minas Tirith, and Harad forces are kept to one side for later in the game.</p> <p>OBJECTIVES</p> <p>The Battle of Pelennor Fields is the greatest battle of the Third Age and has many objectives. This Scenario has five objectives for both sides to fight over. As this Scenario will take a long time, we suggest that you gather your friends and decide amongst you how long to play for (we recommend at least five hours - possibly a whole weekend!) and whichever team has achieved the most objectives by the time the game ends is declared the winner.</p> <p>Heroes of the West - The Men of the West that fight upon the Pelennor are spurred on by those that have led them into battle. Should their leaders fall, they shall follow suit. There are seven key Heroes of the West upon this battlefield: Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Th\u00e9oden, \u00c9omer, Imrahil, and H\u00farin. If, at the end of the game, there are more of these Heroes left alive than dead, the Good player claims this objective. If there are more of these Heroes dead than alive, the Evil player claims this objective.</p> <p>Servants of the Dark Lord - The forces of Sauron are commanded by a collection of ruthless individuals who rule through fear and brute force rather than skill. Without these leaders to keep them in line, the forces of darkness will rout if the battle goes ill. There are seven key servants of the Dark Lord upon this battlefield: The Witch-king, Gothmog, the M\u00fbmak War Leader, Sulad\u00e2n, The Golden King, Amd\u00fbr, and the Khandish King. If, at the end of the game, there are more of these Heroes left alive than dead, the Evil player claims this objective. If there are more of these Heroes dead than alive, the Good player claims this objective.</p> <p>The M\u00fbmakil - These massive war beasts thunder across the Pelennor. If they cannot be brought down, they will spell doom for the forces of Good. If, at the end of the game, there is one or more M\u00fbmakil left alive, the Evil player claims this objective. If there are no M\u00fbmakil left alive, the Good player claims this objective.</p> <p>Gates of Minas Tirith - The gates of the White City must not fall. Should Sauron's forces capture them, the city will be overrun. At the end of the game, count the number of each side's models that are within 12\" of the gates of Minas Tirith. Whichever side has more models within 12\" claims this objective. If the score is the same, the result is a draw.</p> <p>The Pelennor - Upon the fields of Pelennor, there are various points of strategic interest. Holding these will give a significant tactical advantage. There are four Objective markers on the battlefield (see map). Whichever side controls the most of these will claim this objective. A marker is considered to be controlled by whichever side has the most models within 3\" of it.</p> <p>SPECIAL RULES</p> <ul> <li>Charge of the Rohirrim</li> </ul> <p>Any Rohan model that charged in the Move phase may declare a Heroic Combat in the ensuing Fight phase without spending Might.
